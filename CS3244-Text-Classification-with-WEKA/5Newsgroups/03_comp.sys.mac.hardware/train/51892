{send follow up to comp.sy.mac.advocaci. sorri about the header but the 
pnew here doe not let on easili chang the header and i gave up after a 
year of try. thi sheet is also avail by ftp on sumex-aim.stanford.edu 
(36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compar177.txt.}
mac & ibm info-version 1.7.7

the reason for thi gener data sheet is to consolid and condens the 
inform out there, so that peopl in both camp can be clear and accur 
about what thei ar sai about their machin.  sinc comput technolog 
is alwai chang there ar alwai go to be point in which the sheet will 
be lack or incorrect on inform.  so, pleas just don't sai the sheet 
is incomplet or incorrect but also give me clear and concis inform to 
make the need correct.  all price ar in us dollar.
to keep thi data sheet organ pleas provid, if possibl, articl 
citat for the inform provid or correct and keep the opinion to 
a minimum.  as thi is a gener data sheet, keep the info provid simpl so 
i can understand what is be talk about and can explain it to other. 
final, keep the inform relev to the section correct {for exampl, 
os code in rom is softwar contain in hardwar, so no more of the 'but it 
is support in os disk softwar' data for the hardwar section, pleas}. 
thank you.
note:  for proper read off line thi document should be in 9 point monaco.

 note: i am onli show motorola & intel cpu us in mac and most ibm/pc

68010 in the mac these chip ar not list. year onli appear with dead cpu 
and indic first to last year us as a cpu.
cach note:  both ibm and mac us cach extern to the cpu. these extern 
cach increas the speed of the cpu but ar not a part of it.  in most of 
the present mac there ar extern cach built-in while with ibm thei ar 
option {though machin ar gener sold with them instal}.  sinc 
there ar mani differ extern cach {cpu-mac and ibm; scsi, video, disk 
and static ram-mac}, each have a differ effect on cpu perform, and 
thei ar machin {32kb static ram cach in iici, iifx, and iivx}, seller 
{cach card instal in some iici} or expans {iici cach card go up to 
128kb} depend, i have decid to leav them out of the list.

cpu comparison list
as a gener rule of thumb motorola chip ar faster than intel chip at the 
same frequenc {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but intel ha chip at 
higher frequenc than motorola, so thi even out.  the macintosh bibl 4th 
ed. support the comparison between intel and motorola chip for the 68020 
and abov.

<=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address 
line/data & address regist].  the 4mb limit on the 68000 mac bring it 
down to the 80186 and lower chip, otherwis it would compar to the 80286.}

286        ~ 68020 {hardwar segment vs. 68020's 32-bit alu and these chip

hardwar segment's protect mode is us by os/2 1.0 => and window 3.x. 
the us of the hardwar segment and their 16-bit natur put the 286 between 
the 60000 and 68030 in featur and the lc's 16-bit data path strenghthen the 
286 ~ 68020 comparison.}

{in an effort to remov the 'reconfigur the system almost everi time you

develop ar work out 'plug and plai' standard (pc week 03/08/93).}
color support/displai
 mac: 30.24 mhz pixel clock standard.  all present mac support the us of 
32-bit color through 32-bit color quickdraw in rom.  32-bit color quickdraw 
allow an almost transpar capabl to displai and edit x-bit imag in y-
bit color and retain all the color of y-bit color [where x and y 
independ ar 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolut {63 
dpi [12" color] to 94 dpi [palettebook]} or monitor type {includ 
autosynchron vga, mcga and svga monitor with rang includ 66.7 hz 
vertic and 35 khz horizont and onli a hardwar video adaptor (macus 
aug 1992: 158-176).  older machin that support color {se/30, ii, iix, and 
iicx} had onli 8-bit color in rom and need a softwar patch to us 32-bit 
color (macus special 1993:28-29).  
to keep cost down and speed up most mac have onli 8 or 16 bit displai 
capabl built-in, but most of those can be expand to displai 24-bit 
color.    present quickdraw is optim for 72 dpi displai; quickdraw qx 
will chang thi.
in addit, quickdraw allow, in mac with a nubu slot, more then on 
monitor to be us in ani combin, from two monitor show the same 
thing to multipl monitor act as on larg larg monitor with ani degre 
of overlap of the pictur.
vram: video ram.  standard for present non-powerbook mac's handl of 
 built-in video {from a 32-bit color palett}. vram provid run a 8-bit
 color 640x480 displai; expand to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 displai. 
sound output:  standard in all mac sinc the 128k.  stereo sound becam 
 standard with the se/30.

ibm:  even though pc have rom bio definit of how the oper system 
interact with the video hardwar (nan zou), the us of driver bypass 
bio, video harewar inconsit {see super vga below} and nonstanderz
of clone bio have left resolut of video displai hardwar, os and program 
interact up to the os and video hardwar in question (faisal nameer 
jawdat). in addit, ibm and clone maker never bother to provid a 
standard hardwar mechan for softwar to determin what displai mode is 
actual present (matt heali) nor a standard screen-draw toolbox {like 
mac's qd}. as a result the os must be veri well written to detect some mode, 
especi with some third parti card or to us them consitantli {at present 
thing ar so depend on the interact of the program, os, print driver 
and monitor card that edit 32-bit pictur regardless of color mode, os, 
and monitor type/card combin as on can do on the mac is imposs with 
an ibm.  for exampl, on cannot edit a 32-bit color pictur done on a os/2 
486 with a svga monitor on a 386 with vga {18-bit color palett} and do 5.0 
and still have all the color on start out with}.
later ibm machin will have integr graphic acceler, faster 
processor, and modular upgrad and mai have built-in sound card, cd 
rom, and ethernet (pc week 12/14/92).  
mda: monocrom displai adapt
 origin charact-map video mode, no graphic, 80x25 text.
cga: color graphic arrai
 320x200 4 color or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palett, bad for the ey.
ega:  enhanc graphic arrai
 640x350 16 color from 64 color palett [and some lower re]; some version 
 could run at 256 color, bearabl on the ey.
vga:  video graphic arrai*
 320x200 at 256 color, 640x480 at 16 color, and some other, these two ar 
 the most commonli us.  all mode have a 256k clut, from a 
 18 to 24-bit {ibm} or a 32-bit {mac} color palett.  25.175 mhz pixel clock
 (mel martinez).  monitor us analog input, incompat with ttl signal
 from ega/cga etc. 
mcga:  multi-color graphic arrai*
 subset of vga that provid all the featur of mda & cga, but lack some ega 
 and vga mode, like vga 640x480x16 (dictionari of comput term-dct).  
 common on the initi ps/1 implement from ibm and some ps/2 model.
svga:  super vga*
 thi is not a standard in the wai the other were, but instead wa a 'catch 
 all' categori for a group of video card.  as such, with each manufactur 
 us their own implement scheme, svga wa chao with peopl debat
 as to what is svga and what is not.  in an effort to make svga more of a 
 standard vesa wa establish and is us in the newer unit, but thing
 ar still a mess.  video is either 512k [~1990] or 1m [todai], resolut
 of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 color ar common, newer on [sinc 
 1990] have the sierra hicolor ramdac, give 15-bit 32,768 color at 800x600, 
 some of the veri newer on [~6/92] can do 24 bit per pixel [usual 
 at 640x480].  speedwis, too much variat, some veri slow [western digit 
 paradis base, for exampl], some veri fast [s3 86c911 base, for exampl], 
 some ar so-so [like tseng et4000, a veri popular chipset].  some limit 
 factor overcom by 40mhz vl bu & 386's linear address map were: 
 8.33 mhz isa bu, at architectur where the cpu look at the card through a 
 64k "window", etc.
other non-svga standard: 
8514/a:
 ibm's own standard, interlac graphic acceler with graphic function 
 like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardwar. some clone implement 
 from ati ar the fastest video avail todai, though some clone model do 
 not have interlac. 
tm34010/34020: high end graphic co-processor, usual >$1000, some
 do 24-bit, speed up vector-orient graphic like cad.
xga:  extend graphic arrai
 newer and faster than 8514/a, onli avail for mca bu-base ps/2s, clone 
 ar come out soon.  emul vga, ega, and cga (dct).  max resolut at 
 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp mode.
xga-2
 acceler graphic function up to 20 time faster than standard vga in
 window and os/2, includ line draw, bit and pixel-block transfer, area
 fill, mask and x/y address. ha an intellig wai to detect and co-
 exist with other xga-2 card, so multipl desktop like on the mac mai not be 
 far awai.  sinc thi is an architectur, it resolut and color depth 
 isn't fix {ibm implement onli 16-bit [65,536] color, while other 
 compani can have 24-bit color through ibm technic licens}. refresh 
 rate up to 75 hz, ensur flicker free, rock solid imag to reduc visual 
 discomfort, and is vga compat. up to 1280x1024 on os/2.
*some monitor type usabl by mac-see mac section abov for specif detail.

expans
both mac & ibm
scsi: onli extern devic expans interfac common to both mac and ibm.
 allow the us of ani devic: hard drive, printer, scanner, nubu card 
 expans {mac plu onli}, some monitor, and cd-rom.  
 main problem:  there ar a lot of extern devic which ar intern 
 termin which caus problem for more then two devis off the scsi port 
 {a scsi chain is suppos to be termin onli at the begin and at the 
 end.  ani other set up caus problem for either mac or ibm}. 
scsi-1:  7 devic per scsi control.  8-bit asynchron {~1.5mb/s av}
 and synchron {5mb/s max} transfer.  differ is due to scsi-1 softwar
 driver.  "fast scsi-1" is a misnam for 8-bit scsi-2 in scsi-1 mode
 {see scsi-2 for detail}.
scsi-2: 10 devic per scsi control in scsi-2 mode.  scsi-2 is fulli
 scsi-1 compliant and 8-bit scsi-2 tend to be implement as a veri fast
 scsi-1 sinc it doe not requir the differ control interfac in  
 hardwar and softwar that 16 and 32-bit scsi-2 do.  transfer speed ar
 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst {16-bit}, and
 15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  sinc 8-bit scsi-2 can
 us scsi-1 softwar driver and hardwar at 8-bit scsi-2 speed and as such
 is limit to 7 devic sometim it is mistakenli call "fast scsi-1". 
 16-bit fast scsi-2 requir a scsi-2 softwar driver and scsi-2 electron
 but can still us the scsi-1 port.  wide 16-bit and 32-bit scsi-2 requir a
 differ scsi port, electron, and softwar driver from scsi-1 {which
 make them more expens than other scsi interfac}.
mac scsi: asynchron scsi-1 built-in standard sinc the plu.  even though 
 appl develop some specif for scsi control, the os scsi manag
 need to be rewritten to take full advantag of the featur of both scsi
 interfac.  as a result present scsi-2 mac us 8-bit scsi-2 as a fast 
 asynchron scsi-1.  present quadra ar the onli mac with a scsi-2
 control chip built-in (digit review, oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) 
 though thei lack some other part of the hardwar, like the wide scsi-2 port 
 interfac.  sinc other mac requir a nubu card to us scsi-2, older nubu 
 mac had a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubu and cpu.  rumor-some
 cyclon mac {june} will come with a wide & fast scsi-2 port standard 
 and have a rewritten os scsi manag.
ibm scsi:  scsi-1 is not too wide spread yet, gener not bundl with 
 system, except as add-on {eisa and vesa local bu adapt aval}.
 like the mac, 8-bit scsi-2 is us as a veri fast scsi-1 by most control
 out there.  unlik the mac, ibm ha no exact scsi control specif
 which result in ad incompat for scsi.

mac
memori expans: with a few except the mac ha us non-pariti 30-pin 
 8-bit simm memori expans sinc the plu.  while 32-pin 9-bit pariti simm
 could be us in these mac, onli special iici could make us of the pariti 
 featur {by convens both simm type ar call 32-pin simm}.  the iifx 
 us 64-pin pariti simm.  the lc iii, c610/650 and q800 all us a new 
 72-pin simm that is access by 32-bit at a time and is us in ibm.
 the mac doe a complet memori check at startup by write/read everi
 memori locat; if someth is serious wrong with a simm the mac will
 not boot and give a sound chord indic what the problem is.
 sinc mac made befor feb 15, 1993 manag memori bace on data path, simm 
 had to be instal in pair {16-bit} or in set of 4 {32-bit}.  the centri 
 650 and quadra 800 elimin thi with a new memori manag setup that 
 allow memori to be upgrad on simm at a time.  if the simm ar the same 
 size ar us then the memori is 'interleav' across the two simm result 
 in a 10-15% perform boost on ram access (macworld apr 93: 108-109).
printer, adb, and modem: built-in interfac standard.
monitor interfac and sound input: built-in on most present mac. 
pd: avail in se & all present non-powerbook mac. 16-bit {se,

 the lc and 040 bu design.  with an adapt on nubu card can be us in

cpu expans: handl either through the pd or the nubu.  unlik pd,  
 nubu cpu card {exampl-radiu rocket} allow us of multipl processor at 
 the same time.  thi is like have two or more mac in the same box abl to

appl to control it machin by put kei hook for the mac os {quickdraw, 
menu command, print, mous, scsi & sound driver, etc} in rom, which requir 
clone maker to us the rom chip or read rom on to disk {which requir 
access to the proper mac sinc differ mac have slightli differ rom 
chip; plu vs classic for exampl.}  with kei hook for the os support 
interfac in rom, program do not have to worri as much whether the disk os 
ha the necessari hardwar command or that those command ar consit and 
therefor can write smaller program.  thi also allow appl greater control 
over hardwar-softwar standard and that the disk os can be smaller and, with 
some of the tookbox command code in rom, with lower ram requir then a 
total disk base os.  mac us mask rom which is as fast as dram (jon 
wtte).
6.0.7: singl program usag base requir: 1 mb and dd floppi, 
 cooper-multitask base requir: 2mb and hd floppi.  
 featur a gui, cooper-multitask [multifind], standard program 
 interfac, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. network receiv part of 
 appleshar softwar is bundl with the os. ha a 8mb ram barrier and is a 
 24-bit os. some third parti product allow 14mb of virtual memori as long as 
 real ram is below 8mb.
6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print driver.
6.0.8l:  system 6 for some mac that requir system 7.0.x.
7.0.x: base requir: 2mb, 40mb hard drive, and 68000; de-facto standard 
 to run all featur well: 4mb, 80mb hard drive, and 68030 {lowest present

 'free' os.
7.1.0: 7.0.1 with worldscript support, speedier, and less ram usag than 
 7.0.dot (macweek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; pc week 9/7/92). to run in 32-bit mode 
 on older machin it requir the 'mode 32' or '32-bit enabl' extens. 
 mark the start of appl sale it mac os instead of allow free upgrad
 {bundl with new machin, $49 for 7.0.x upgrad, $99 otherwis}.
 [the instal ha a bug that when upgrad it mai keep some old system 
 font from the previou system insid the system file.  thi can eat up ani 
 ram benefit and caus other problem.  appl itself recommend remov all 
 font from the system file.]
a/ux 3.0 [unix]: need 8mb ram {12-20mb suggest}, 160mb hard drive, and 
 a 68030 or 68040 equival to run.  thi 32-bit preemptiv multitask os 
 is larg due to be unix and need translat between it and the mac 
 rom.  price: $709.
note: sound output wa support in os 3.2 to 6.0.5 by mani format 
includ the follow:  snd, wave, asnd, fssd, qssn, smsd, soun, dc2d, and 
dcfl.  in 6.0.7 the sound manag wa optim for the sound standard 'snd' 
and aiff which caus some playback problem for the old format, though most 
still plai.

ibm
 machi have littl gui code, data, and hook present in hardwar for 
programm to work with, so most of the code must be provid in the os.  
sinc hard disk were slow the disk os code is read into ram.  in addit, 
what littl rom code there is also read into ram {a process call shadow rom}  
thi result in faster implement sinc ram is faster then prom or 
eprom.  have most of the os code on disk ha the advantag of be abl to 
better optim the code given a certain piec or collect of hardwar which 
is harder with a rom base system due to the 'patch' need.  in addit it 
reduc the need for and size of patch if a major revis of the hardwar 
support is need.
side note:  the ftc charg that microsoft form a os trust by not provid 
all featur document for it os to develop outsid ms and design 
it window and do app to fail under os/2 ("undocu window") and 
"there is deliber code in [window] nt beta which caus the instal to 
abort if os/2 boot manag is present" (gregori hick, info-ibmpc digest v92 
#201).  due to a conflict of intrest by on member the vote of the ftc 
judici council for action against microsoft wa a tie which result in no 
action.  rumor-the ftc will presu the matter, like to the point of 
choos a new member or whole new council.  in addit the govern ha 
turn down microsoft's copyright of "window" which would allow it to charg 
a fee for develop us their hook (pc week 03/08/93).
microsoft os
do 5.0: ha a 640k barrier with it own memori manag, a 1 mb barrier 
 with third parti memori manag.  thi 16-bit os requir that each program 
 must provid it own print driver and be 16-bit {program need to be do 
 protect mode interfac (dpmi) compliant and run on a 386dx [32-bit 
 protect mode] to break these barrier}.  contain the gui shell present in
 do 4.0.
do 6.0: do 5.0 with the ad featur of a built-in file compres, disk 
 defragment, debugg for the config.sy file. it need a $80 modul for 
 network {cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} 
 (byte april 1993:44-46).
do 7.0: 32-bit do. in develop (pc week 04/05/93).
window 3.0: run on top of do.  break 640k and 1m barrier but still ha to

 equival of mac's qd call window gdi [graphic devic interfac].
 thi doe not have a consist applic interfac {like earli mac
 program  (1984-1985)} nor a veri larg program base {compar to do} and
 still tend to slow the machin down (info-ibmpc digest v92 #186) with speed
 is more depend on the displai adapt then on the cpu (bill coleman).
 window program tend to be disk and memori hog compar to their do
 counterpart (byte april 1993:98-108).
window 3.1: a faster version of window 3.0 with better memori manag. base 
 requir 1 mb, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2mb, hard drive, 386sx. 
 appl plan to releas it print driver for thi (pc week 12/28/92).
window for workgroup:  to run well: 4mb ram and 386dx (pc world feb/93:160).  
 intermediari between win 3.1 and window nt.  it is basic window 3.1 
 with built-in peer to peer network support.
window nt:  beta releas take about 50mb of disk space [includ the 
 swap file], and 12mb ram {beta ar notori for ram usag especi in 
 the interact between debug code and program complier, henc the 
 report of 24mb requir}.  releas version suppos to need 8mb ram 
 but, gate himself now recommend 16mb ram (pc week 04/15/92).
 thi 32-bit os ha protect mode multitask, multithread, symmetr 
 multiprocess, a recover file system, and 32-bit gdi.  ha built in
 network that is osf dce compliant and can handl up to 4gb of ram.  even
 though some peopl see a juli 4 releas date (infoworld nov 16/92), rumor
 is that the final version will not be avail befor oct 1993

other os
pc-do 6.0: ibm's version of do 6.0.  it run window much faster then do 
 6.0 due to faster file i/o and video handl (infoworld feb 1, 93).
dr do 6.0: same as do 5.0 with some extra {like built-in data compress}

 version {novel do} of thi mai us a version of the mac finder and appl 
 file manag system (pc week 12/14/92; infoworld dec 14/92).
os/2 2.0: unix like featur and unix like requir; 8-16mb ram,
 60mb {us 17-33mb} hard drive, and 386dx cpu. thi 32-bit multithread, 
 multitask os can address up to 4gb of ram but ha to us a fast swap file 
 to us more than 16 mb ram on isa system us dma {direct memori access}. 
 ibm plan to us talig's oop in futur version of thi

mac 7.1 [work name: star trek]:  appl had system 7.0 run off intel 
 chip and is look at make a 7.1 version avail for ibm 
 (computerworld nov 2/92; macweek 03/22/93). at present thi is plan to run 
 on top of novel's dr do, requir a 486 or equival to run and that app 
 will need to be recompil (macweek 03/22/93).  view as novel's answer to 
 window nt.  the complex of pc hardwar set up is on reason for slow 
 progress {thi seem to appl/ibm's wai of lead to the powerpc line out in 
 late 1993/earli 1994 and pink os in late 1994-earli 1995.}

powerpc
rumor-ibm will build it powerpc 601 by late 1993 (infoworld june 8 & 15, 92; 
macweek 7/13/92; pc week 3/15/93).  it will have microchannel bu and xga 
video (carl b jabido), and will run nativ version aix and mac app (pc week 
3/15/93); there have been no comment on compatabl of do or window app.
appl's powerpc 601 machin {tesseract} is plan to be out jan 24, 1994 and

 that it will run window/do program.  ibm os section for detail
nextstep: possibl port see ibm os section for detail.

os number crunch (mel park)
mac
 arithmet is done in a consist numer environ {sane or standard 
appl numer environ}. float point number ar 96 bit long when an 
fpu is present and 80 bit otherwis. except, such as divid by zero or 
take the squar root of a neg number, do not caus an abort but ar 
handl in a logic consist manner. 1/0 produc the intern 
represent for infin (inf).  1/(1/0) produc zero. the abov treatment 
of 1/(1/0) occur in an fpu-equip machin even when sane is bypass and 
the fpu program directli.

ibm
 float point number ar 80-bit with a hardwar fpu, 64-bit when 
emul.  the wai thei ar handl is depend on the code of whatev 
compil or assembl wa us for a program. on older do complil 
except could caus program abort; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the do 
prompt at the point where thei occur.  most present compil handl thi 
better.  result: there is littl consist handl of number between do, 
window and os/2 program nor between program for just on os.

network [includ print]
wysiwyg print can be a problem with either mac of ibm machin especi 
if on send truetyp font to a older style postscript printer.
mac
hardwar: built-in localtalk network port and a built-in printer port.  
localtalk ha moder speed (230.4 kb/s) requir special connector for 
each machin ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to 
includ veri old mac} or the network port {standard todai}.  built-in 
ethernet is becom common but mani older mac requir a pd or nubu card at 
about $150-$300 for each machin.  these card provid three connector and 
transceiv {thick, thin, and 10baset} for ethernet.
the macintosh quadra famili and some centri model includ ethernet 
interfac on motherboard, with transceiv avail. tokenr ha been a 
network option sinc 1989.
softwar: appletalk {the suit of protocol} standard with mac os, which can 
us varieti of media type.  appleshar client softwar includ with the os 
as well and can connect to file server such as novel netwar, 3com 3+open, 
banyan vine, dec pathwork, appl's appleshar server, system 7 file share 
machin, and afp server run on varieti of unix host.  mactcp allow 
typic tcp/ip commun (telnet, ftp, nf, rlogin).  a later version 
will have unix x/open transport interfac (xti) built-in by the end of 1993 
(macweek 04/12/93).  third-parti softwar to connect to nf server.  dec 
pathwork provid decnet support.  peer-to-peer file share softwar 
built-in to system 7.1 (see os section).  full server softwar is extra. 
print requir connect of the printer and the printer be select in 
the chooser.  chang printer is by select a differ name in the 
chooser.  the same is true of connect to server.
print bug:  monaco truetyp font is differ then the screen bitmap font.
 {quickdraw qx is supposs to fix thi and similar problem.}

ibm  
hardwar: localtalk [not wide us], ethernet,  and tokenr.
softwar: novel netwar, banyan vine, decnet, window/work group, appletalk 
protocol, and appleshar {subset of appletalk}.
each of the ms-do network scheme ar, in gener, total incompat 
with the other. onc you have chosen on, you ar pretti much lock-in to 
that product line from then on.  window/work group is a littl more 
forgiv and remov some of thi problem.  novel netwar is the biggest, 
{~80 percent of the corpor market.} and in gener is more power and 
offer better control/manag/secur than appleshar, but it's also more 
complex to set up and manag.  thi will chang due to the us of the mac 
finder and file manag system by novel. (pc week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  
infoworld dec 14/92; macweek 3/22/93)
print {veri os depend}
do: if it's a singl user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, 
 and don't worri about it {tweek mai be need with poorli written 
 softwar}.  network print is not control by the system, but is mostli 
 implement by the actual program, therefor perform vari from on 
 softwar program to the next.
window 3.x: support standard driver and can do a good job of show "job" 
 in the print queue, but it alwai list printer as "activ"... even if thei 
 ar not.  thi becom a problem if there ar sever incompat printer 
 on the same net, becaus there's no wai for softwar to reliabl determin 
 which printer is activ right now.  window for workgroup is more mac-like 
 and intellig about thi.
os/2: mac-like; the os deal with printer, with app make call to the os.
print bug: due to poor program some program for all the abov os do 
not have wysiwyg print.  thi is the fault of the program in question and 
not that of the os involv.

price issu: thi is veri dynam with mac provid more build-in featur 
than ibm and ibm be more 'get onli what you need' then mac and price war 
by both world.
the ibm machin' modualar natur prevent ani kind of true hardwar 
standar, which in turn requir os and program to be veri complex to 
handl all the variat in hardwar.  when on add all the standard mac 
hardwar featur to an ibm {built-in input/output sound support, scsi, pd,  
built-in monitor support, built-in network, standard mous interfac, and 
nubu 90 in higher machin} the mac tend to be cheaper then an equival 
equipt ibm machin {especi sinc some ibm monitor can be us with mac 
which cut some more of the mac's cost (macus aug 1992:158-176)}.
 some price us some of the info in thi sheet and macus april 1993.
all mac below come with a pd slot, vram, and scsi-1 built in.  except where
