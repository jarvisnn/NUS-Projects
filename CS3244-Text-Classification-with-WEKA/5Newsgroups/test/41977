and tell me if it turn out okai?



i'm not all too sure about my view softwar.  i *hand*-convert thi

thing in "vi" from a sun rasterfil... what a pain!



for folk who haven't the slightest, it went like thi:



-------------------------------------------------------------



		how to make your own x-face:

		   in 0x000f easi step!



	1. scan my driver' licens into a *.pcx file.

	2. us wingif to 'trim' my face out of the licens,

		'reduc' it by half, and

		convert it to *.bmp.

	3. us paintbrush to touch up manual.

	4. us wingif to 'reduc' it by half again.

	5. us paintbrush to touch up again.

	6. us wingif to 'reduc' it by half *again*

		and convert it to *.gif.



		[now over to the unix side...]



	7. us snapshot to convert the *.gif to a sun rasterfil.

	8. us iconedit to touch it up and

		convert it to an x bitmap.

	9. us "vi" (ye, a *text* editor) to manual convert

		the rasterfil into the "uncompress x-face" format.

		(lot of global "ed" command, and by the time you're

		 done you'll mirror hex bytewis in your sleep!!)



		[now over to the *linux* side...]



	a. us "compfac" to convert it to what you see here:



 %:a<m@dob}bo"'e",eeqgbn7qy(en7as5u([k//"g{6^hibi9x8~+pd($}6szf"&vvxcxsn

 8mw^0g#nvhe%w,`x"[j0s{r.~%zs:o|hfu=lwzygh



	b. try view it by whatev mean you have avail.

	c. go back to step 9, but do it *right* thi time.
