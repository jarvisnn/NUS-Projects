sorri, thi must be a faq, but it's a quick fix that i need to take care of  

befor a demo in less than 24 hour from now! couldn't think of a better place  

for a rapid answer than comp.sy.mac.hardwar.



i need to connect the serial a of a compac 386/20 pc to the printer port of a  

mac iici. doe anyon have handi the pin-pin rout for the cabl that would  

allow thi connect? 



the serial port on the compaq is a male db9. how would thi map to the din8 of  

the mac serial? i tri on of those realli short femaledb9-maledin8 cabl  

that appl sold as adaptor to plug in macintosh serial peripher from the  

pre-macplu era. thi cabl didn't do it. do i need a null modem adaptor as  

well on the db9 side of thing? 



i just need to be abl to map the data tx and rx pin correctli.





thank kindli,
