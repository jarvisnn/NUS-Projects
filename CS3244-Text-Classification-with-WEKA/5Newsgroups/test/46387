i've built xcoral on my system (suno 4.1.3, x11r5, motif 1.2, ow 3.0)

and it build fine, but when i run it, ani child window that xcoral

open,

1) lock the mous into the window area

2) doesn't accept ani input from the mous.



needless to sai, thi is a pain in the ass, as i have to go find an

empti termin to login and kill xcoral.



is thi a problem with openwindow or motif?  is there a patch?
