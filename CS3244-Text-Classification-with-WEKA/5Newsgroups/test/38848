i do not have specif knowledg of lap-link or telix, but my recommend

for ani packag is to follow each on's instruct for make the null-

modem cabl.  the reason is that each on mai be differ sinc there isn't

realli a standard for pc to pc commun.  the follow is a tutori

i wrote up that will give you an understand about rs-232 and null modem,

but you should still check your softwar!



i will eplain a coupl of detail of rs-232.  rs-232 is

a commum specif for commun between a comput and a

modem.  actual it can be between ani end system and ani commun

hardwar.  the terminolog us is data termin equip (dte) and data

commun equip (dce).  rs-232 spell out the voltag level, the

connector type, the pinout, and the signal protocol.  the connector is

a "db-25" but ibm ha set an altern "standard" of db-9.  the primari

signal ar transmit data (td), reciev data (rd), and signal ground (sg).

there ar other signal that provid control between the dte and the dce.

for exampl, the dte announc that it is power up and readi to particip

in commun via the data termin readi (dtr) signal.  dtr is an

output on the dte and an input on the dce.  similarli, the dce announc that

it is readi to particip in commun via the data set readi (dsr)

signal.  dsr is an input on the dte and an output on the dce.  ok that's

five signal; there ar onli four more of interest.  the request to send (rt)

signal is an output from the dte (and an input to the dce) that is us

to ask the dce permiss to send data.  if the dce agre, it send an ok

via the clear to send (ct) signal.  (for complet, the ct is an input

to the dte and an output from the dce).  the other two signal (of interest)

ar ring indic (ri) and data carrier detect (dcd).  these ar both input

to the dte and output from the dce.  ri is just what you would expect -

a signal to the dte sai that someon is attempt to establish a connect

to the dce.  thi is rather specif to the modem / telephon line setup.

dcd is a wai for the dce to announc that the "connect" ha been establish

i.e. the local dce is talk to some remot dce.  there - that's it.  oh

there ar mani other rs-232 signal defin, but thei ar obsolet.  i have

explain the nine signal that ar on a pc.  the pinout ar as follow:



name    db-9     db-25

 sg       5        7

 td       3        2

 rd       2        3

dtr       4       20

dsr       6        6

dcd       1        8

rt       7        4

ct       8        5

 ri       9       22



now to address your problem at hand.  when you connect a pc to a pc (a dte

to a dte), there is no dce pair in the middl and therefor the rs-232

signal definit don't work out quit right.  there is no dce to assert

the ct, dsr, dcd, or ri.  so the common thing to do is to not us these

signal at all - and also forget about the dtr and rt output as well.  if

thi is done you simpli make a null modem (a cabl) that pass through sg,

and cross td and rd (i.e. pin 2 of on end connect to pin 3 at the other

end, etc).  the problem with thi solut is that a pc that want to send

data ha no wai of know if the other pc is readi.  it would have to just

send the data and hope it got through.  therefor a better null modem would

includ the dtr/dsr pair cross.  a particular point a confus is in the

softwar area.  just becaus you run the wire doe not mean that the soft-

ware will us them.  if you ar us the built-in bio to control the

serial port, then the bio dictat what wire you need and how thei ar to

be us.  but if you have a comm. packag such as brooklyn bridg, or lap-

link or telix, then those packag dictat the cabl requir.  the

onli thing you can guess reliabl is the sg, td, and rd.  the dtr/dsr is also

fairli common.  there is on more issu that need to be address here.  and

that is flow control.  in the rs-232 scenerio, the dce's ar respons for

flow control and it is assum that the dce couldn't possibl over-run the

dte.  by thi i mean that as long as the dte ha it dtr line assert, the

dce will send data - without request permiss first.  note the contrast

to the other direct of data flow: the dte must request permiss by

assert the rt line and it must wait for the ct signal befor it can

send.  and now in the dte to dte scenerio, the question is do you need flow

control?  the answser is usual.  but how?  for non-binari commun,

on common techniqu is xon - xoff which is implement in softwar - no

wire ar dedic to flow control; the td and rd carri the xon and xoff

command.  thi type of flow control can be us in addit to hardwar

flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binari data becaus

your data might includ the xon or xoff code and caus erron conrol

signal.  (a work around is to have the softwar insert and extract "escap"

code, but the hardwar flow control is prefer).  the problem with hard-

ware flow control is that there is no standard.  there ar lot of wai to

do it and i bet thei have all been tri.  on cornerston of all the method

is to us the rt/ct for on direct.  but beyond that anyth is fair

game.  again, you must look to you comm packag for cabl requir.

but i bet you'll find that on cabl (if wire properli) could work with

all of the packag as long as thei ar of the same vintag.  by the wai,

i am familiar with on packag that us rt/ct and dtr/dsr for flow control

the rt is request to send and the dtr is readi to reciev, the ct is the

clear to send and the dsr is the request to reciev.  thi doe not mean a

differnt cabl - it is just softwar.  the clincher to all of thi cabl

stuff is that it is common to have the uart directli control by the ct

signal which mean that the ct must be present even if you ar not support-

ing it in softwar.  for these case you will find cabl that short the

rt to the ct at the same end (or perhap the dtr to the ct).  other

possibl short might be done just becaus the softwar expect certain

signal that you don't have (or don't feel like provid becaus it would

mean addit wire).  specif i am talk about the dsr.  short

the dtr to the dsr is not a good idea in gener but you mai find cabl like

thi.  it is a bad idea becaus it defeat the whole purpos.  on more

"gotcha" signal is the dcd.  some softwar (includ the pc bio) expect to

see the dcd befor it will work.  thi signal sometim get short with the

dtr.  but my favorit null modem ha the rt and ct short at each end, but

the rt is also connect through to the other end and connect to dcd.  and

of cours the dtr/dsr ar cross as ar the td/rd and of cours the sg must

pass through.  thi null modem work with most softwar.  the flow control,

if ani, can us the rt/dcd with the dtr/dsr.  if your comm. packag doe not

specifi the cabl requir for pc to pc connect, then i suggest you us

thi on.
