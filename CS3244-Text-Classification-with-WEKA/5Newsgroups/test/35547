look be consist. first you post someth that seem to suggest that you see

xv be an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 

so i post and asi it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 

so you post and sai it is not a bug, you never said it wa, i have misunderstood

etc.

now you ar sai:



>we discuss about error(s) in xv 2.21 which show imag onli as 8bit,



if you would make up your mind what you ar claim it would make the

discuss a *lot* easier.



----------------

eh? sorri, i don't understand what you ar sai here. i am awar that english is

not your nativ languag and have tri hard to fathom your mean, but thi

paragraph defeat me.



>gamma and color correct ar easili done to 24bit imag

>back to 24 bit imag.



ye *as i origin said*, global chang ar easili possibl.



but thi statement contradict what you said earlier: 



>>>i wrote someth about make color modif quickli

>>>with 8bit quantiz imag and onli at the save the imag to file

>>>process we have to make the modif to the 24bit imag.

>ok, you're write about situat that user want edit imag as 24bit

>and user want edit individu color -- your question, by the wai,

>jump off the discuss a bit.



no i don't think so actual. 



you were talk about load a 24 bit imag into xv (by quantis),

manipul the colour in the colour editor, then somewhow appli these

chang to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. xv let you edit individu

colour. where is thi sudden jump off the topic?



>my solut doesn't work, becaus there's no colormap with real 24bit

>imag 



ye i am awar there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!



>-- you see, user see 24bit imag; go back to 8bit is silli.



i do not understand what thi statement is suppos to mean.



>about chang individu color in 8bit/quantiz/raster imag:

>chang individu color in colormap is useless in most

>case if the imag is quantiz and raster -- small chang mai

>make seriou error to anywher in the imag.



???

what ar you sai

???



>xv allow thi featur, but i don't recommend to us it with the

>mention type imag.



ah! now we see thew problem! first you want to extend xv to allow edit of 8

bit preview of 24 bit imag. then i point out problem with thi. now you ar

sai there is no problem becaus you, person, happen not to us those

part of the program that caus the problem!!





>moreov, xv is not a paint program; you can onli make those global

>chang. 



not sure what you ar sai here. certainli on can make local chang.



>in full 24bit xv, chang individu color sound like

ye that is on possibl approach. i would find a program that took such an

approach clumsi, howev.



>ok, i don't have thought veri much 24bit paint program, never seen

>such in good view and ar not plan to make such. not to mention

>24bit paint program in 8bit screen...



well here we agre - you have not thought it through veri much. you don't seem

to have a consist point to make and contradict yourself from on post to the

next. ok, we all have off dai - perhap you should step back and think thi on

through.



>>ye again. what *is* (wa?) wrong with xv?



>it save 8bit/quantiz/raster imag as 24bit jpeg; jpeg is not

>design for that.



as i said in the last post, jpeg is a compress algorithm. it is a wai of

save disk space by trade off qualiti against compress. i fail to see what

the problem is. you have not propos ani workabl altern.



>also, human expect that 24bit will be save as 24bit imag; 



speak for yourself. you ar the *onli* person i have met or spoken to who,

have quantis a 24 bit imag down to 8 bit, expect thi process to somehow

revers when the file is save; keep all modificv that heve been made

to the 8 bit imag palett.



perhap that is why you yuse the singular?



>sai,

>person would like to crop part of the imag and save it, then it is

>expect that the imag still is the same. 



look, next time you import a 24 bit imag into xv look carefulli at the main

control panel - it tell you how mani colour have been alloc to the 8 bit

imag. xv make it abundantli clear that you ar not edit the origin 24 bit

file. you ar the *onli* person who claim thi is confus.



>so, xv were design

>without think about human interfac and how human expect the

>program work -- design error.



is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)



read my lip. xv is a program for view and modifi 8 bit imag. it let

you import other imag. it show, i would sai, a good deal of thought about the

human interfac. and everyon els seem to us it happili for the purpos it

wa design for. it make no fals claim.



>i have heard xv were design first for 8bit imag/file, but

>it were not good idea to take full 24bit imag without make

>major chang to the origin design.



if you would come up with a solid, logic, well argu and lucid descript of

precis how these propos extens would work, feel free to post them. so 

far, you have not done so.



>so, even all screen imag ar 8bit, the process imag and save

>imag could have been 24bit veri easili, instead of 8bit.



argh!! after all thi, a comment like that. `veri easili'. ok, go ahead and code it

if it is so easi.



or altern, look up the term `import' and 'non-revers transform'.



>befor anybodi will make a note: ye, i mai as well make a lift where

>even the manual tell the correct situat, it doesn't solv the problem.

>(american: the lift is just an exampl :)



i think thi is a bit of an exager.



what you ar actual sai is, you got into a lift (elev, if you ar in

the state ;-) ) and mistakenli press the down button to go up. everyon els

had no problem. now you ar try to sue the manufactur...



>well, my text mai be a bit hard read, 



you bet



>hopefulli you suggeed to

mostli. leav asid the languag issu howev, it betrai some veri wooli

think (as you yourself admit) which is the same in ani languag. go think

some more.
