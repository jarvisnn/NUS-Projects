how can i captur buttonpress/buttonreleas event in multipl client?

i want to know if the user is still at the displai befor lock the screen.

i can get  keypress/keyreleas and pointer motion event, but if the user

is press the mous button in the same locat (the mous doesn't move)

i can't captur the event.  



the o'reilli xlib program manual (vol. 1) sai on page 252;

   "onli on client can select button event on ani on window at on time, 

    due to the grab that automat take place."  



ani help would be appreci.
