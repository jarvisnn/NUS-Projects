   is it possibl through either pin configur or through softwar

   program to chang the ip number on an ethernet card?



the ethernet card doesn't us the ip number (32-bit, usual

#.#.#.#); it us the ethernet address (48-bit, usual

#:#:#:#:#:#). i have never run across an ethernet control that

cannot be program to us an address that is not assign to it.

decnet requir thi featur.



howev, that said, there is no reason to ever chang the ethernet

address.  thei ar global uniqu, the first three byte be

assign to the manufactur by the ieee, and the last three by the

manufactur.
