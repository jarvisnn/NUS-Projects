    the origion bit is miss but long/short follow:



    the origion poster ask if he/she could us ani old vga/svga

monitor with a centri (henc titl).  



    the answer ot thi question is an unqualifi ye.  you can us ani

old vga/svga monitor with a centri.  you do need an adaptor (i us a

mac vga-q from jame engin (510) 525-7350) to run between the two

machin.  the adaptor i have mention will convert a centri to a

three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.



    now, the special interest disclaim.

 the abov answer is correct for us a vga monitor at 600x400

resolut.  if your monitor will sync to 56khz horizont the abov

adaptor will allow you to choos 800x600 resolut (i prefer thi on my

1604s).



then you have the question of match adaptor and sync rate.  i would

advoc call jame engin becaus thei seem to have a clue.  as

to the comment by the person who said don't bother call appl becaus

thei will treat you like an idiot thi is total untru.

    appl will treat you like a f**king assanin idiot for even

consid go third parti and if you want thi treatment want you

to pai for their thech support line (the supposedli compitantli on) and

then still ha no fu***** clue.



person experi.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor maker

doesn't see to extend to mac (soni, magnavox).  in addit to thi to

find out the info you will have to call dealer unless you can find the

sync rate elsewher as ad like hardwar that fit

(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolut give the most

favor rate (which usual mean you can get thi if you us a

special applic video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolut

1168x832 on thi $5,  9" "super smelli sock" monitor that will let you

displai two full page side by side.  all you need is our reason

price "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an

ultra fast horizont sync rate of six fast kilohertz and three khz

vertic.")







note:  with the soni 1604 at least on the centri 610 built in video

board us an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the

side of the imag after adjust the horizont width as favor as

possibl.  us a 800x600 adaptor thi can be reduc to about half an

inch.



                                                                    -a.
