i am plan on upgrad my old xt compat system with a new

motherboard, hard drive, and 1.4 mb floppi.



i am interest in us my old power suppli (150 w) to power the new

hardwar, if possibl.  



i have been told by the motherboard vendor that i could probabl

us the suppli if it had twelv wire go to the motherboard.

(appar some xt vintag suppli had onli 11 wire -- the

12th wire is a 5v line us to charg the motherboard batteri).



my question is ha anybodi tri bring an addit wire

out of an 11 wire suppli or us an auxiliari power sourc

to charg the motherboard batteri?



i do not wish to bui an entir new power suppli if i can 

make us of my exist on with simpl hack.



thank you for ani inform.  

an email repli to rarbana@rcsuna.gmr.com would be fine.
