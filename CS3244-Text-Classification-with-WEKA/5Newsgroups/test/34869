hi, terri. it me again. i couldn't agre with you more.

i final receiv my datadesk keyboard a month after sendng it to

datadesk to have it check.  thei didn't tell me over the phone that

you had to wait befor press the shift kei to disabl extens.

actual, thei did, but not until a dai befor my keyboard

arriv. but a month earlier, thei were of no help at all.

i realli think thei need to put a disclaim on their keyboard

manual.
