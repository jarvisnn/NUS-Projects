i have been us the join command for mani year now, mostli with good

success in duplic unix-style file mount.  you will hear lot of

peopl curs join becaus thei confus it with the do append command

(a trueli gnarli hack), but don't believ them.  you also will hear

peopl sai that microsoft recommend that you not us join.  but, in

microsoft's window 4 workgroup resourc toolkit, the follow appear:



  "join, an ms-do util, work fine with window for workgroup 3.1 if

  you do not chang the state of the join drive dure a window for

  workgroup 3.1 session. thi includ ad or remov join drive

  from within window for workgroup. we recommend that you do not us

  join when run window setup or window for workgroup 3.1."



within thi caveat, join appear to be valid under window.  howev, i

have found a coupl of applic that don't deal well with filesystem

that have been "mount" us join.



in particular, the worst offend is word for window 2.0x.  it get veri

confus when you edit and then try to save a file on a join drive. it

want to creat the save file as ~nnnnn.tmp in the current dir, then

delet the old file and renam the ~nnnnn.tmp file to the *.doc file.



unfortun, wfw usual write the ~nnnnn.tmp file in some idiot

place other than the current directori (often in the root dir of the

join filesystem, but not alwai).  then, after delet the origin

*.doc file, it can't find the ~nnnnn.tmp file to renam it.  unless you

search your disk system, the document is gone.



i have also found subtl problem us the mk toolkit from a do box

when join filesystem ar present.  i us to join c:\temp with a 4meg

ramdisk, but mk sometim get confus when do an "ls" on the c:\temp

dir, and miss some file in the temp dir.  (thi is difficult to 

reproduc, but it goe awai total when join is not us.)  i think

thi is a window problem, rather than mk's, sinc it work ok under raw

do.



so, i would suggest that you can us join, but be awar that it mai not

be as robust you would like.



wouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drive (i.e. z:) under the main

file tree, rather than have all those darn drive letter? unfortun,

join won't let you do it.  there wa talk on the net about a simpl patch

to let join work on network drive, but i don't rememb the sourc.



it's too bad the join command is not better implement, sinc it would

avoid us all those stupid drive letter.  i realiz that messdo wa

meant for casual, even ignor user, so "mount" all the drive in

on file tree might be confus. but, it look like ms is go to carri

thi over into window nt (anoth os meant for casual, even igor 

user -- not!).  with all it's old famili system baggag, mayb ms need

a recoveri group so thei can get on with life :-(.
