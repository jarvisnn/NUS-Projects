	three q's:



1) is it reliabl?



2) how doe it send the inform from a ms window app over

the x11 protocol? doe it just draw everyth as graphic into

on window, or doe it us multipl window and essenti work

more cleverli?



3) if i want to run ms word, for exampl, remot, do i have to

run a separ copi of ms window remot, and then start ms

word from that, or can ms word be start remot on it own?



	thank a lot!
