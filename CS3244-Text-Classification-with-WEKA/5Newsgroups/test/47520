if you ar plan on us thi on a regular basi, connct the printer

to file can becom bothersom becaus window then ask you for the filenam

that you want to creat. i've found that put a line in system.ini in the

port section with just a path and filenam work. the onli problem is that

if you send more than on job, the second on delet the first.
