	anyon who think that tiff is too complex hasn't dealt with

	cgm, asn.1, cda, dca, sgml, or ani on of a number of other

	veri success file format.  peopl seem perfectli capabl

	deal with these other.  deal with the format of tiff

	is frankli less difficult than deal with the dct, lzw, and

	fax encod of the imag data.  the major of the librari

	which deal with tiff ar dedic to these other issu rather

	than with simpli decod the tag and paramet.



	perhap peopl ar overwhelm in comparison with some rather

	simplemind format such as gif, pcx, and bmp, but to suggest

	that tiff is so complex as to be doom to failur is ludicr.



	that doesn't mean that gif isn't fine, but don't even thing about

	us it in mani instanc.  gif is veri nice for us in low-end

	photo applic and for screen grab and such, but it would

	never do for high-volum or high-resolut system.  fax is nice,

	but it doesn't do color (and gif doesn't do b&w all that well).

	jpeg is nice for high-resolut color, but is slow for low-end.



	the advantag tiff bring to the tabl is it abil to handl

	all these situat (and then some).  natur it's more complex.

	but i'ld rather propos tiff imag solut over imag

	system base on have to deal with 3-4 file format anydai.



	you mai find that tiff is too complic for your person tast

	but pleas don't wrail against it's complex.  the complex

	it contain is requir to provid the function it doe and

	doesn't come close to the complex found in most commerci

	viabl file format.





	if we're in philosoph argument against complex, let's all

	go program in scheme and forth and do imag with run length

	encod.
