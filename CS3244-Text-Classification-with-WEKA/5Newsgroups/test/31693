: the origin poster, john navitski, said that he might us the monitor on

: a sparcstat lx. the lx is abl to gener a pictur at 1280*1024 at

: 76 hz. not offici, but i tri to set thi resolut and refresh rate

: and the lx came up with a non-sync screen. our tube obvious couldn't

: handl thi speed. at 67 hz, it work perfectli.



i don't know which tube the viewson 17 us, but it ha an 82khz horizont

bandwidth so you can go pretti high.  i ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which wa as

fast as the orchid p9000 could drive it.  also, the 17 doe claim to be abl

to support 1600x1280, but i have no experi with that.



sinc i have the spec sheet in front of me i'll type some in:



crt:	17", 0.28 mm dot pitch, 90 deg deflect, rgb mediou short

	persis, tint (tm=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflect



input signal:  rgb analog 0.7vp-p, 75 ohm (also ha set for 1vp-p)

	sync: h/v separ(ttl), composit (+/-), sync on green (+/-)

	horizont freq: 30-82khz, vertic freq: 50-90hz

compat: pc from vga to 1600x1280 non-interlac, mac iici and abov

control: contrast, bright, posit, size, degauss, p-p voltag, color

	temp, sync select, color tune, moir on/off.

video band witdth: 135 mhz

max bright: 120 cd/m2 at white flat field

misconverg: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner

dimens: 16.3"x16.22"x17.64", weight 42.6 lb



i don't know what some of those mean and don't verifi their accuraci, i just 

type them in.  other thing thei hype on the sheet ar a 'doubl quadupl

dynam astigmat focu'.  right.  thei mean thei us two lens.  advanc

invar shadow mask.  viewmatch color control which thei claim is and easi-to-us

system that adjust color to close match printer output.  as near as i have

been abl to figur out, thi translat to separ control for red, green,

and blue.  how thi make it easi to match for printer output is beyond me.



but beyond the hype, the monitor is veri pleasant to look at.  sharp, clear,

and isn't nearli as bad as the nec's for reflect.
