the mai issu of pc/comput page 246 ha a window hint and tip for

just thi thing.  you have to edit the win.ini file and add a coupl

of line.  i tri it and it work.  i actual made my titl bar

and icon text, and icon text smaller.  on my monitor it work well.

you can select a larger font also.  you edit the win.ini file with

a font name in your system directori.  read the articl becaus i would

not want to retyp it here in case i type error and caus your

system problem.
