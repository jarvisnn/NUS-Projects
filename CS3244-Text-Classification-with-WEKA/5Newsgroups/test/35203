you can print to a file from an hp (or ani other printer).  just go into

the printer section of your control panel.  select the printer you want

to re-direct to a file, and click on connect.  then choos :file as the

port to connect the printer to.



when you print from ani applic to that printer, window will prompt

you for a file name for the file into which you want to captur the

printout.



it's pretti easi.



good luck!
