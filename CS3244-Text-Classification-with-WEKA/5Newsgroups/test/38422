i hope someon can help me with the follow problem - i'm sure there

must be a known solut.



given a rectangl defin by



-x <= x <= x  and -y <= y <= y  where x and y ar constant



and a parallelogram defin by



-c1 <= a*x + b*y <= c1  and -c2 <= c*x + d*y <= c2



where c1, c2, a, b, c, d ar constant and b/a != d/c (i.e. not

parallel line)                                ^^

                                          not equal to



what is the area of their intersect?



   what i'm after is some gener algorithm suitabl for all rectangl

and parallelogram that can be describ by the abov equat.  at the 

moment it look like i'm go to have to look at all possibl case 

and examin each seper e.g.



1) rectangl enclos parallelogram. 



2) parallelogram enclos rectangl.



3) two corner of parallelogram insid rectangl

            -x            \     /           x

                           \   /

                            \ /

                             "



4) two corner of parallelogram outsid rectangl



   i hope someon can help.
