you need to start the x-server with -indirect it_name.



if you start it with -indirect localhost, it us the loopback adress as

it's adress. so when it try to contact anoth host, thi on try to answer

on it loopback adress. not good.



rememb that everi machin ha the adress 127.0.0.1 on the loopback network.
