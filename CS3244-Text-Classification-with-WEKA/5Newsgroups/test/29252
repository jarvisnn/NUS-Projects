while i do not think he is ly, i also feel hesit to take anybodi "on their

word" unless thei can attribut a sourc for thier claim. with all the fud 

and misinform and misconcept and outright li fly around the 

advocaci newsgroup, i do not trust ani unsubstanti rumor or claim 

- especi from ani employe of ibm's or microsoft, or anyon who seem to

have a vest interest.
