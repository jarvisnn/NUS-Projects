i would like to see a seriou discuss on the best wai to instal window

from a novel administr's point of view.

 

i just got off the phone with ms access support and wa told that thei

(microsoft) ha decid to implement, as a standard for softwar support,

the local setup (describ below) as the "most advantag instal".

if thi is true and microsoft deem thi to be the most prudent instal

then i will compli but i'd like to hear it from administr first.

 

the local window instal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

window is fulli instal on each workstat hard drive (assum the

resourc ar avail).  from a network administr's implement,

he/she would instal all window disk on a network drive us setup/a.

then instal window on a per/machin base by run setup off the network

to instal the complet system on the local drive.  in thi wai, all driver

ar avail to the setup procedur w/o the need to chang disk.

 

advantag:

- reduc traffic - run window local reduc network traffic due to

  the local access of main window file.

- network independ - if the network fail (and thei all do at on point

  or anoth), the local instal would allow user to keep produc

  and reduc the cost of down-time.

- faster window - theoret, window will run faster from a local hard

  drive than over a network.  thi mai be a hard point to prove if the network

  ha an optic backbon and/or the network drive ar significantli faster

  access than local on.

- a user travel from machin to machin doe not need to worri about

  vari setup (monochrom, color, type of mous, etc...) sinc the

  window instal is assign to the workstat.

 

disadvantag:

- cost - instal window local requir a signific amount of disk

  space.  workstat now must be purchas with a hard disk that can

  increas the cost of the workstat from 10 to 30 percent.

- administr - local window instal ar veri difficult to

administ.

  new driver for peripher ar constantli be made avail, each of

  which would have to be individu instal on each workstat.

- secur - user now have access to eras or corrupt their own system

  file from simpl ignor.  thi could result in quit a headach for

  administr who mai have to constantli repair damag instal.

- backup - we all know the problem back up local hard disk.  the backup

  set (if done via a central tape system) get veri larg veri quickli.

  backup individu (to floppi) mai not happen at all.  thi mai be

  elimin if it is assum that local hard disk onli contain replac

  applic and *not* user data.

 

the share window instal

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

window is fulli instal to a network disk via the setup/a procedur

describ abov.  user (or administr) then instal a minim set of

file to individu "user" directori.  these directori mai be on a

local hard disk or perhap a network "home" directori.  the bulk of the

window system file ar maintain on the network in a singl directori

(some 400+ file) and ar access (share) as-need by user throughout

their window session.  the user's file consist of a small set of file

that the user ha updat dure hi/her window session.  these includ

group file, .ini file and other regularli updat file.

 

advantag:

- a singl locat for all file make updat to drive easi.  as

  an updat driver becom avail, it onli need to be instal in thi

  singl directori for all user to be abl to take advantag of it.

- assum that the user' file ar maintain in network (home) directori,

  the administr can easili edit ani .ini file as-need to correct

  problem that mai aris.  thi includ win.ini and system.ini.

- backup of all pertin file is done easili.  even if the user' file

  ar on a local hard disk, the bulk of the window system is back up with

  all driver updat.

 

disadvantag:

- network traffic - sinc all window file ar be share in a network

  directori, traffic on the network can becom a problem an effect the

  speed of window.

- if the network crash, all product come to a stop sinc window's

  is reliant upon the network for it file.  loss of data usual occur

  as well sinc user work in window at the time of the crash will

  usual not be abl to save their work.

- although minim, disk space is still a consider.  if the user' file

  ar maintain on the network, a larg number of user can caus a

  signific util of disk space due to their person window

  file alon.

- user cannot easili move from machin to machin unless the workstat

  hardwar ar similar.  thi is due to the window instal be

  ti to a particular usernam (in the case of network user file).

  

the discuss

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

i would like to know, from other administr with a larg window

userbas, how thei prefer set up window.  person, i have

setup numer instal us the share setup.  all window and

applic file ar on the network with littl or no util of

local hard disk.  in fact, i sold a network on the fact that the

compani would no longer need to purchas hard disk for their workstat

and thu save that much more monei.

 

i would also like to see recommend for applic.  should

app such as word and/or excel be instal local regardless of how

window is instal?  again, i keep all file on the network for easi

backup and administr but thi is "put all egg in on basket";

if the network crash, work come to a halt.

 

now i am sure microsoft (and i know your out there) ha their own

idea about thi and their insight would be of great valu but i hope to

hear from peopl with "actual" work experi with user and network

administr.
