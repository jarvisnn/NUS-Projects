summari: result of iisi clock modif poll

keyword: iisi,clock,poll



thi poll wa conduct to help user decid whether or not to alter their

iisi clock oscil. i have attempt to gather as mani case histori as

possibl to find some estim of success and risk. the number of repli

probabl show how rare thi modif is but give the impress that

success rate mai be higher than the previou 80% estim. 24 of 24

machin were abl to run at 25 mhz when no add on board were present.

thi is not a scientif survei but it is the best we have to work with.



thank to all who contribut to thi poll. 





issu:



	speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appear to be the norm for machin without

		add on card. all report machin were abl to us

		25 mhz as long as no add on card were present. sever appl

		nubu card were in us. no machin with the nubu adapt

		wa abl to go faster than 25 mhz. on wasn't even abl to

		achiev 25 mhz with the nubu adapt in place

	

		at speed of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distort and

		hi densiti floppi disk problem have been report.

		

		note: unless specif list below, machin were not

			test with a higher speed clock to failur. henc,

			the 25 mhz oper machin mai well work at

			higher speed.

			

	damag) on user report pull out the plate of on pad. thi wa

		repair and the machin is oper. on other

		report pull the pin out of the origin clock oscil

		dure desold. there is on second hand report of a user

		put a gash in the motherboard with a slip solder iron.

		

		no report of static discharg damag.

		

		no report of high speed oper caus damag.

		

		then again, i also don't have ani report from user of

		defect parachut.

		

	add on board) compat appear to be a problem with appl nubu

		adapt. sever other add on board have been us with

		success. see case histori

		

	heat sink) virtual all modifi machin had a heat sink instal.

		these were often the to-220 style power transistor type. some

		us epoxi. some us a dab of heat sink compound with a dab

		of cyanoacryl glue. there wa also us of a clamp with a

		bolt through the hole in the motherboard.

		

		

		

case histori:	



all speed ar the effect cpu speed (1/2 of clock oscil). all report

cpu version were 20 mhz.



1)  27.5 mhz oper. ran for 10 minut at 31 mhz befor crash.

    no fpu or other add on card

    heatsink cpu onli

    on 24 hour/dai

    no damag dure instal

   

2)  27.5 mhz oper without appl nubu adapt. 25 mhz top speed with

	appl nubu card instal

    heatsink cpu onli

    on 24 hour/dai

    no floppi problem

    no damag dure instal

   

3)  27.5 mhz oper. unabl to boot at 31 mhz

    heatsink cpu onli

    no floppi problem

    no damag dure instal

   

4)  25 mhz oper

    work with the follow two configur

	

	  	a)	realtech fpu adaptor card

			realtech cach card

			supermac 8*24 pdqsi

		

		b)  	supermac fpu adaptor card

			supermac video spigot

			supermac 8*24 pdqsi

			

5)	33 mhz oper

		fuzzi startup sound

		problem with hi densiti disk



6)	33 mhz oper

		fuzzi startup sound

	heat sink on cpu and chip to right of cpu

	

7)	25 mhz oper. occasion crash at 33 mhz



8)	25 mhz oper.

	us fpu rate at 16 mhz without difficulti

	

9)	25 mhz oper.

	pd adapt with a spectrum 24pdqsi graphic card and a 

	videospigot, a 20mhz fpu

	heat sink on cpu

	

10)	25 mhz oper. 33 mhz fail after sever hour.



11)	25 mhz oper

	 5/80+quicksilv/fpu(onli upgrad)

	 

12)	25 mhz oper. tri 33 mhz - system won't start. 

 	heat sink on cpu

	configur with

		realtech fpu/adapt card

		supermac 8*24 pdqsi

		realtech cach.

	cpu on continu - no problem.

 	floppi work fine at 1.4mb @ 25 mhz

	

13) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu

	

14) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu

	

15) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu

	

16) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu

	

17) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu

	on 17-19 hour per dai

	

18) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu + cool fan

	no floppi problem at 25 mhz

	

19) 20 mhz oper. bomb soon after startup at 25 mhz with nubu adapt

	20 mhz rate cpu

	ram 70 ns in slot, 80 on motherboard

	

20) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink ad to cpu later. no damag while unheatsink.

	appl nubu adapt with fpu instal.

	

21) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu

	

22) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu

	

23) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu

	

24) 25 mhz oper

	heat sink on cpu
