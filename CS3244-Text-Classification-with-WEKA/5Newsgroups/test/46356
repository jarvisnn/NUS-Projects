i  _do_ know  that  ibm system, the ps/2 56slc2, in  particular, have

absolut no  problem  with  os/2--never had  a "random" crash  while

run ani of  my program under  os/2.   in fact, i  don't  rememb

_ever_ crash.



of cours, i realli don't run ani  os/2 program, just the  same bunch

of do and window stuff that i've alwai been run.



and  when  i  had  the  56slc  (thi is  the  386slc  system)  run

do/window, i had onli  on crash, and it wa consist.   ftp had a

tendenc  to  crash  whenev  i would  get  larg  file (>1mb)  from

particularli fast  client  (dtr's  150k-200k/sec), i  figur out the

problem wa with smartdrv's write buffer--if i turn off the write

buffer, everyth would work fine.



ftp under os/2 ha never lock,  though.  i can even format  floppi

(to us the most often cite exampl of the superior of os/2.)

yeah, i guess i'm will to admit that os/2  is somewhat sensit to

specif hardwar.  wp51 for do work perfectli fine on my slc2...

well,  i save all  my  person file to floppi,  and when  i did that

under window, a floppi save of a larg file hung up the system.



i  also found  it quit bothersom to  have  to  continu tweak the

task option  on fractint for do whenev i want to do a fractal

comput in the background.

the idea is  that os/2's do session can see more memori than window

do  session.  i  let  xpl (a  sharewar calculu program) see around

720kb of free _convent_ memori, which let me  do bigger symbol

manipul than is possibl  under straight do (where it would see

around 610kb of convent ram.).  i  also found it realli handi for

my _own_ do-base program, which, without  ani re-write, could now

handl larger data set, simul for more iter, etc. of cours,

the  point is  now moot,  sinc  the os/2 program i now write  simpli

_never_ run into memori limit.  i never program  for window,

so i don't have much of a comparison here, though....
