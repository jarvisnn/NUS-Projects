you bet your bippi it's built like a tank.. and not just mechan either!



thi past weekend we had a nasti thunderstorm and the imposs (*&^%)

happen - i got a direct lightn strike on my hous - and to the second

floor outlet box into which my faith deskjet 500c wa connect. there

wa a .303-bullet-size hole in the aluminum side with some solidifi

aluminum slag drip from it. you could actual see the electr box

through the hole! the outlet itself wa fri and i'm still amaz the

whole damn hous didn't burn down.



i lost 2 electr garag door open,  2 vcr's, 2 telephon (all of which

were on the opposit side of the hous), a zyxel u-1496e high speed modem,

a vga monitor, a 1024x768 color monitor, the rs232 and parallel port on my

x termin and a wd lan card in my pc. not a good night!



but, the deskjet ran as soon as i found a function serial and parallel

port to connect to it.
