subject: re: why the drive speed differ??

line: 11



the most like explan mai have someth to do with the fact that a

greater densiti of inform exist on the larger capac disk drive than

the smaller on. if your run the drive on a mac i would recommend a

sharewar util call timedr which test seek, scsi throughput and

rotat speed. thi util should let you know what the differ ar

between the drive.
