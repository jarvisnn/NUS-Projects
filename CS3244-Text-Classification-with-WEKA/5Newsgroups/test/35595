	i'm pretti sure most industri strength imag process specif 

system (i.e. photo process gear) us as much as 96 bit of color info.

why? why not, oversampl is never a bad idea especi if the

hardwar's onli task is imag manipul, and profression photograph

demand profession result.



: 	also, to settl a bet with my roommat, what ar sgi's flagship product?  i know of

: iri, indigo, and crimson, but what ar the other on, and which is their top-of-the-line?

: (sadli, i have access to none of them.  just a dec 5000/25.  sigh.)



	strang question, but anywai, there's the vgx line, the newer

indigo^2, and the onyx system ar the new big boi on the block (you

can get a 24 processor system with twice the graphic perform of

a realiti engin). there's more, but i don't have my handi "period 

tabl of sgi's" on me...
