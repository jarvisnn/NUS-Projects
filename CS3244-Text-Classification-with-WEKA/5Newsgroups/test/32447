my telephon line seem pretti stabl and i have the supra as well.  work 

great but with everi pass dai i fall behind on how mani great 14.4s ar 

out.  zoom is out of the question from what i'm hear.  at&t ha a great 

product from what i hear and the sportster is realli cheap now too.



if you want to receiv a fax, your comput will have to be on, but not 

the monitor and of cours the modem.  you can set the number of ring that 

will receiv the fax on a specif ring you set with fax stf softwar.  

it's entir up to you how to arrang that.  i've had fax sent to me 

which is great but i've been home to set it.  i don't have a need to set 

fax receiv up all dai.  also i hear there is a devic that can channel 

all incom phone signal for about $70.  rumor also that the phone 

compani can hook you up with the same gizmo for about $5 if that's what 

you need.



best of luck and write back if you'd like more feedback.
