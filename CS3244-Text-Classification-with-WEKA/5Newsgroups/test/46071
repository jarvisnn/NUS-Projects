ibm, appl, motorola readi to unwrap powerpc 601 processor





the wrap will come off the powerpc 601 processor thi week, as motorola

corp., ibm, and appl comput inc. detail the result of their yearlong

effort. thi first in a seri of powerpc processor will be a 32-bit

processor with a 64-bit memori interfac, much like intel corp.'s

pentium, with the capabl of perform as mani as three instruct

per clock cycl, accord to sourc familiar with the chip. motorola

is expect to releas the chip in volum by year end in two

configur, run at 50 and 66 mhz with perform of 40 and 50

specint89 mark, respect, sourc said. float-point perform

for the 3.6-volt processor will be even better, as their specfp89

perform will be 60 and 80, respect. the 601, a scale-down

version of the power 220 chip develop by ibm for it rs/6000

workstat, will also includ a 32k singl buffer cach on the chip

with protocol to support motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bu

built in. the chip, which is be design initi to support the

micro channel architectur, is bu independ, so vendor could develop

powerpc- base system us a number of differ architectur,

includ isa, eisa, or sun microsystem inc.'s s-bu design, on sourc

note.



accord to sourc familiar with the develop effort, motorola ha

been extrem success in develop the powerpc as an inexpens

architectur, despit a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million

transistor us a 0.6-micron technolog. initi chip ar expect to

be price from $300 to $400 -- onli slightli higher than intel corp.'s

486 processor -- but could be sold profit for less than $100, on

sourc said.
