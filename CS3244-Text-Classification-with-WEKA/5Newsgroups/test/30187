there wa a post about someth similar a while back.  it seem window

doe *not* take it upon itself to free up ani sy. resourc an

applllic is us when that applic is done.  that job is left

entir to the applic.  that is, the applic ha to clean up

after itself when it quit.



anyon out there know if there is a util for window which  will

clean up sy. resourc when an applic quit (mother.zip???).



peac,

mickei
