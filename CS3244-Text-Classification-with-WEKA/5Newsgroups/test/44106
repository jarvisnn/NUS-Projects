i am work with visual basic v2.0 for window.

specif, i am work on an applic that gener format report.

sinc, some of these report can be rather larg, my first question is:



1.  is there a wai to increas the size of a list box or text box in

visual basic/window beyond the 64k limit?



as i have not (as yet - be optimist :-) come across a wai to get

around the abov problem, i am work on the follow approach:



i am try to creat my own defin templat in ms-word, us the

wordbas macro so that i can open up word from visual basic(vb) and load

thi templat of mine, which will work in the follow wai:



it will first open myown.ini file (creat in vb - at the time when the

user select the kind of report he weant) and read the section from the

.ini file and jump to the appropri code in templat - which will then

open and read a file pertain to the section it read from the .ini file.



1.  when us the getprofilestr function in wordbas, is there a wai

to specifi/chang the default .ini file (which is win.ini) to myown.ini file?



2. when us the file input$ function in wordbas - is there a wai to

read more than the 32k at on time?

ani help will be appreci.
