don't mind if i do.

as someon who would _love_ to see xv go to 24 bit, thi

would be plenti for me.



    a) xv can load a 24 bit imag, and displai it in all it's

24 bit glori on 24 bit x displai.

    b) all other oper (crop, dither, smooth, etc.) ar not

support on 24 bit imag.



how hard would thi be?
