if it's ani consol, i had a similar problem. as i recal, if i exit

from a do session while in full-screen mode, the menu titl had chang to a

scrambl version of the icon titl font (or someth like that). it onli

start happen after i us icontitlefacenam in win.ini to chang the

desktop font to arial. so i stop exit from do session while in

full-screen mode.
