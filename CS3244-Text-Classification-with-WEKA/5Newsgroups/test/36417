	i got a few request ask for a summari, so i'll attempt on

here:





	here's the on i know of:



	wind/u		- bristol technolog



	hunter sdk	- hunter system



	mainwin		- mainsoft



	libwxm          - visual solut





	hunter 



	the compani is go through some big chang.  i expect

to eventu see the hunter sdk pop up with a new name.  at the moment, it

is difficult to get phone call return and otherwis obtain info.

hopefulli thei will post someth about themselv onc thing settl down. 



	visual solut



	libwxm is a product that i just heard about.  thei don't

yet support mdi or mfc.  libwxm wa us to port vissim, a mathemat

model packag.  doe nativ motif widget, like wind/u from bristol.

contact carri lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  she's veri help.



	mainsoft



	thi translat window sourc to a unix execut that

can switch off between a window or quasi-motif look and feel at

runtim.  thei skip the xt and xm (motif) x toolkit level and go

straight to xlib.  thei don't yet support mfc.  thei're at 415 896 0708.



	bristol



	thi compani that seem to be on the right track.  wind/u us

xlib/xt/xm to give a *real* motif app.  thei seem to be do the most work

in try to support thing like dde, common dialog, and more on the horizon.

my contact there is knowledg, respond to my email, and wrote an exampl

program for me show how to obtain x widget from window handl.

thei're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.
