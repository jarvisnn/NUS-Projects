   i am set up my do/unix box on a 116m id and a 412m scsi drive

and wa wonder about the us of the (ms-do 5.0) join command.  i

like the wai it set thing up sinc i won't have to stick with the c:

d: & e: (crap) that do enforc.  i like how it would mimic mount

point of unix filesystem.  i have heard that there were problem

with us it, or at least under older version of do.  pleas tell!
