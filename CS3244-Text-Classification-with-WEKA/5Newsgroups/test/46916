i've found that i have to add the "-8" option for displai jpeg

with the new version.  for some reason, if i don't, it goe into

24-bit mode and the result imag is displai with 216 color 

(from a 6x6x6 arrai) instead of 256 and look grainier.  sinc i'm

on the ubiquit 8-bit pseudo color displai i would have thought it

could tell that.
