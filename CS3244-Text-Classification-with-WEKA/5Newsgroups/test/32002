	greet,

	we have a network of ~20 sun workstat, run suno 4.1.1

and openwindow 3.  7 of these ar sun 3's that we have modifi to

run seth robertson's xkernel imag, effect turn them into

xtermin.  we us xdm (x11r4) to manag the displai.



	when we had 3 xkernel machin, thing work fine, but when

we instal 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weak.

with 7 client to 1 sparc 2, the sparc 2 window manag is eventu

get mung.  



	let me try to be precis:  the user sit at the machin

that doe all the actual process for these xtermin is have

control of hi keyboard and screen yank awai.  (when thi wa the

depart chair, it wa kind of cute).  we poke at xdm for a few

dai and ar satisfi that it is not at fault.  our current theori is

that olwm (the sun version) wa not meant for run multipl copi

on on machin (which is what happen -- the consol user run olwm,

and everi xtermin log in ha olwm run on the xtermin

server). 



	ha anyon had ani prior experi with thi sort of behavior?

	can anyon shoot obviou hole in thi theori?

	how about obviou gimm?

	and, of cours, ani idea on how to solv it?



	ani idea ar greatli appreci.
