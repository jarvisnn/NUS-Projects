i us it all dai everi dai (maintain our ftp site and answer mail

via support@qdeck.com), and i can honestli sai that in the last few

month i've never had my machin go down due to ani sort of tcpip network

manag instabl. (of cours, i've crash my machin quit a few time

on purpos, dure beta test and that sort of thing, but the tcpip

portion is quit stabl...)



howev, keep in mind that dvx and the network manag ar onli go

to be as stabl as the softwar thei sit on top of (so if your underli

network kernel is flakei, you can't expect dvx to be terribl stabl...)

it just goe as a window that ha graphic drawn into it. (to vastli

over-simplifi what goe on, we just take the window graphic api call,

and translat them directli to x-protocol; unfortun, window wa

not realli written to be network-awar, so sometim we see a speed

penalti when an app doe someth stupid, like send a big white bitmap

to eras someth rather than just draw a white box; fortun,

that sort of thing is rare...)

you need to run ms window, which word then run insid. you could run

multipl window program within the on winx window, and window ha

wai to automag start winapp when you start window, so in practic

it's not realli a major problem. i have my system set up so that i can

run winx, which automat start word full-screen (for window), so

i never see ani part of window but word...)
