rest of the desktop is fine.  for wallpap bitmap smaller than thi, i 

have no problem.  i have a friend who ha an 800k bitmap which he ha no 

problem with, so it is possibl.  it is also possibl to displai these

bitmap us cshow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video 

card is not at fault.
