pleas research carefulli.  just becaus a fax modem behav like

a printer on a "local" machin, doesn't guarante function 

when a "local" machin ha fax softwar print to a "remot

instal" fax card.  i tri thi with workgroup and the 

fax softwar didn't like it at all.  could have been winfax's

peculiar but i don't think so.  a lot of special hardwar

interact take place intern.  in my case, a fax manag

program mere "intercept" the print job and spool it to

it's own directori, not print manag's spool directori.  to

softwar, it appear the job wa "print".  print manag 

plai no part in the handl of the actual process.



pardon me if i've incorrectli assum thi is what you were

up to.  a trueli network-awar fax-modem will most like be

requir, or a lot of weird setup and tinker.



good luck.
