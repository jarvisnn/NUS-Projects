i believ that appl, sun and a number of other desktop machin

manufactur have agre with the govern to incorpor

power-save techniqu;  thi is also someth that govern in

other countri ar like to requir in the futur, so expect to see

it.  thi mai includ the abil for the system to fulli power down

the monitor, via a control power outlet, and power it back on

automat.  (is thi a "sell" on screen saver softwar compani?)



goal for "idl" power consumpt have been set at someth like 30

watt for the system, not includ the monitor (? don't quot me on

thi).



note that in mani busi, the save will be substanti,

especi if you factor in reduc load on air condit system.

sun did a studi that indic that simpli power off monitor for

the night would save the compani (sun itself) on the order of $1m per

year.  put other (and automat) power-save featur in would

probabl have greater than doubl that valu.



given that we ar see more and more reason to leav our work and

home comput on (get fax, automat get email, ...),

build power consumpt control into all machin ha a potenti to

cut ~2% off the nation power consumpt, base on data i heard.



btw: when encourag employe to power off monitor when leav

work, it wa point out that thi should onli be done with monitor

with the power switch on front.  there wa some indic that

monitor with power switch on the rear ar not design to toler

lot of power cycl.  thi mai onli appli to the monitor we us, but

might be worth check if you happen to have a monitor with the switch

in back.
