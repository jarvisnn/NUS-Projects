lpt port don't recogn baud, pariti, etc. set.  you might be tring

to connect a serial printer to a parallel port.  try thi: attach the serial

port of the printer to a serial port on the pc.  us the mode command to set

the com port set.  try



c>mode com1,9600,n,8,1



to set the port paramet.  then us the mode command to redirect the

printer port lpt1 like thi:



c>mode lpt1=com1



thi should work.  good luck!
