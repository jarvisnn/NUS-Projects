answer pleas by e-mail, sinc not all group in the header ar carri here.



hi!



person, i like nextstep veri much. even more when i realis how much a  

burden ordinari x or window program is. i also like object-c better  

than i like c++.



but, sometim the restrict ar there. for instanc it sometim ha to be  

ms-window or x. now i'm look for pointer to tool on those environ  

that come close to nextstep, the appkit etc. also, environ that support rapid  

prototyp (like with ib) without produc spaghetti-code as soon as you want  

to do real work.



mayb stepston with some window version of a kit of ui object? interview  

(what it is exactli, i don't know. i kind of lost touch with that world when i  

start with nextstep.)



thank,
