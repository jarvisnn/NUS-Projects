i have the logitech hand scanner for the mac.  it us a scsi

interfac box that the standard scanner unit plug into.  i

have tri my friend's ibm hand scanner with the scsi box and

it work.  see if you can get logitech to sell you the scsi

box by itself.  warn:  most of the cost of mac handscann

is contain in the scsi interfac box, so it could run up

to around $200.  when i upgrad my old style scanner to

the new grai scale model, it cost $75; thei just gave me a new

scan head and softwar; the box wa the same.  the grai scale

scanner + interfac run about $300; make it around $200 for

the interfac.
