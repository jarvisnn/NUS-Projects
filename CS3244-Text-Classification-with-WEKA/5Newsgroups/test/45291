yup, i bought the darn thing caus it wa sturdi. i carri it around in

an unpad (unless you consid all the paper and file and folder)

bookbag (shoulder strap littl job from eddi bauer). i've travel

cross countri sever time with walkman, discman and tape, book and

comput all pile in their. my pb100 work happili, and i'm type on

it right now... it ha a global villag teleport 9600 v.32 intern

send/receiv fax-modem, and i just love it.



unfortun, i have seen a new duo 230 that a friend bought as a

primari comput (i have a mac iisi and se30 as primari home

comput, and quadra and iici at work in the lab). and while amaz

at the light of it, i wa kinda shock at the flimsi of the

screen. i'm sure it'd break real easi....

geez, we ar a soni familli. our neighbor work for zeinth and hate

it (alwai ask why we didn't bui zeinth product). nice gui

nevertheless. we still have two work soni color trinitron from

1972 and 1974. older on is on it's second pictur tube, but both

work. now thei're releg to the old 8-bit atari comput and atari

2600 game machinc, as well as our not-that-old younger sister's

nintendo game machin. soni doesn't make tv's like thei us to

though, the newer mexican assembl-line tv's ar not that reliabl or

sharp anymor... dad also just got a 35" direct-view soni (god, the

thing weigh a ton!). :)  still, where would we be without trinitron,

cd player, or the verit walkman????
