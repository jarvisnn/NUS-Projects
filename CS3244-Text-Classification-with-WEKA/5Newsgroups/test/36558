i receiv my graphit vl on thursdai, and i've had a littl bit of 

experi with it now.  in gener, it feel *fast*, although thi

is the first vlb card that i have tri.  still, the result ar 

impress.



with my 486dx2/66 w/16 mb, run at 1024x768/256, i've had the follow

wintach 1.0 result:





card				wp	cad	spread	paint	overal

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ati graphic ultra		13.5	14.5	19.1	25.0	18.0

ati ultra+ (no apertur)	11.2	13.8	10.7	20.9	14.1

hercul graphit vl		16.1	67.8	41.4	52.8	44.5



unfortun i don't have the number here, but the ati ultra pro vlb

had an overal wintach score of about 26.  the ultra pro wa nearli as

fast in text handl, but wa blown awai in the cad and paint test.



as an addit test, we hand-time a complex coreldraw! slide resiz/-

redraw time.  there wa no swap, but i'd expect there is a fairli

heavi load on the cpu.  the graphit redraw time averag about 10.2

second, with ati ultra pro at 12.0.  thi jive with steve gibson's

content that the isa graphit is faster than an ati up on hi complex

micrografx draw document.



so far, i'm *veri* impress.  the driver look solid, and the card fli.

the instal and util ar differ, but compar to ati's.  and

i didn't have to wait for build 59 for some reliabl...  with hercul'

softwar develop special, you can get an evalu copi of the card for

just $225 (or $200 for the isa version).  call 800-532-0600 if you want to

give it a try -- i'm a happi custom now!
