which bu???



i think there ar sever reason :-



50mhz motherboard ar harder to get right

50mhz need a fast l2 cach - 12-15ns is a good idea

50mhz need to be slow down to make a compliant vesa bu

66mhz dx2 chip ar faster for a lot of thing





with a good, fast l2 cach a dx2/66 is go be be faster than a dx50...



what do i have?



a dx50 of cours!
