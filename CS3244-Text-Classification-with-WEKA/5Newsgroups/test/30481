i have a 486 sx 25 and i recent ad a scsi drive to my system us an  

adaptec 1522 (non busmast) control. yesterdai i ran coretest to  

find out drive perform and these ar the valu i got



seagat 106 meg: 875.1kb/sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track 

quantum 400 meg scsi: 991.2 kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.



first off all ar these good result? i don't know what typic valu  

ar.



what i'm wonder now is the follow. my swap file is current on the  

id. i could move it to the scsi which is 13% faster, but then i would not  

be abl to us 32-bit access which might actual make it slower. so on  

which drive should i put my swap file to get best result? is there a swap  

file speed test program out there?



final, i also ran the abov test with the aspi2do driver load and i  

got no differ whatsoev in perform. is there ani reason at all  

why i should load thi driver?



thank in advanc, i will post a summari if i get enough respons.
