actual, the 295 is for the 33 mhz powercard, not the univers powercach.

the 33 mhz univers powercach with fpu and adaptor can be had for about

$500 (still not a bad deal).  i believ the powercard is on gener 

older than the univers powercach, and the on primari differ is that

the powercard is machin specif while the powercach can fit into mani

mac with the proper adaptor.  both card ar 68030 base.



i'm not sure if the hardwar or softwar with the powercard is otherwis 

differ from the powercach (perhap someon could enlighten me?).



i would also add that i call river comput the other night and these

powercard were go veri fast.
