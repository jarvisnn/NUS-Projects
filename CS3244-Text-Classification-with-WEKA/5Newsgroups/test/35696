i am *almost* done port xfree86 1.2 to a new piec of displai

hardwar, but have run into a snag i think mai be somewhat

commonplac, so i'm send a net-feeler.



i have a displai that is a non-interlac, memori map, 1-bit

720x280 displai.  the server's view of the world, (obtain via xwd |

xwud), seem to be exactli what it should be.  howev, the displai

version of the framebuff give the impress that the server is

us scanlin that ar too long.  after a bit of experiment, it

seem that the problem wa that the server wa pad the line out to

a word boundri, but the scanlin size in the buffer is 90 byte, which

isn't exactli divis by four.  chang the follow defin in

mit/server/includ/servermd.h:



----



#defin bitmap_scanlin_pad  32

#defin log2_bitmap_pad		5

#defin log2_byte_per_scanlin_pad	2



---



to:



---



#defin bitmap_scanlin_pad  16

#defin log2_bitmap_pad		4

#defin log2_byte_per_scanlin_pad	2



---



wa not exactli the right solut.  how do i tell the server either

(a) don't pad the scan line at all ('caus thi server is onli be

built to run on thi particular displai), or to pad onli to byte

boundri?



i'm us a custom version of xfree86v1.2, under mach 3.0.



thank

brian
