hmm, depend on how you defin 'clean'. jordan implement the system

depend stuff in a wai that you have basic implement for,

call it, oper system type, then you go ahead and write a includ

file for your specif machin or oper system us the basic

implement. sinc both jordan and i haven't encount a 

os flavor yet, that is fulli posix, we haven't gotten around to

realli implement (and test) a top-level includ file specif

for just posix. the posix routin ar us in the sun specif file

tty_sun.i for exampl, but here we also us some bsd stuff. all in all

it still is probabl better to implement a includ file for each and

everi oper system than '#ifdef'ing in exist on. the type

of mess that can result from that can clearli be seen in the xterm

sourc. even if quit a bit of code get copi almost unchang a 

coupl of time, thi onli us up some disk space, sinc onli the 

"driver" actual includ from the toplevel includ file will be 

compil into emu.



it shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fulli

reli on the posix stuff, but unfortun i don't have a linux

system avail to me, so i can't do the port myself. i would suggest

you read the readm in term/sysdep and if you have ani problem or

question, contact me and we could try to sort thi out. unfortun

we have to reli on help from the net on thi part of emu, sinc we 

just don't have access to that mani differ system.
