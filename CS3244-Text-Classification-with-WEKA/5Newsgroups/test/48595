doe anybodi have a data-sheet handli for the abov-mention card?  i

bought on, san manual at a local surplu shop, and want to try it out

with the crywyr packet driver suit.  



the irq and interfac-select jumper ar pretti straightforward, but i

don't grok the set of w10-w18 (also label a15 through a18).

could somebodi tell me which set of these four jumper correspond

to what i/o address?



is there anyth els about thi card i should know, befor i

plug&plai?
