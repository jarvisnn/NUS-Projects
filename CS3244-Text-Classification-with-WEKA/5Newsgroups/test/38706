i'm write a mail manag system us word for window 2.0 as

a front end. the user dial up a remot system and download a batch

of mail as "foo.txt ." i've set up an autoexec macro in winword to load

"foo.txt" ok, but subsequ invoc of the macro will of cours

pose file name content problem.



what i'd realli like to do is to creat an autoexit macro in winword

that would move "foo.txt" to a specifi directori, renam it us

the current date and time, and delet the origin "foo.txt ."



in other word, "foo.txt" get renam as "5012300", sai, on mai 1

at 23:00- the user get a time-index backup of hi mail file and

"foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, sinc my autoexec

macro point to it.



my main question is thi: 



how mai on renam a file from within a wordbas macro to includ a 

time/date variabl in the new filenam? 





thank-
