i tri to send thi as privat mail, but mail to benj@ossa.hq.nasa.gov wa

reject, so here it is:



here is an extract from the readm file that come with macx:



user of remot command with sun machin mai find that their remot command 

appear to do noth and there is no output from the sun machin.  thi is due 

to a featur of the sun rexecd network daemon which quietli disconnect from 

request machin that ar not known to the sun|s network address (/etc/host

or ni host) databas.  to successfulli us remot command with a suno-base

machin, there must be an entri in the network address databas for the 

macintosh which is run macx.
