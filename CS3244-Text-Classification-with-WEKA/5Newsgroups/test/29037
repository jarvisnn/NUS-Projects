  i had a similar problem with my stylewrit i (the origin!).

have you tri clean the print head? with the swii driver, it's

and option in the print dialog box. sometim i had to do it sever

time to get the crud out. ye it wast ink, but it beat those

white annoi line.

  anoth idea is to print a coupl of page with just a big

black box. it can help to get the ink flow.

  good luck!
