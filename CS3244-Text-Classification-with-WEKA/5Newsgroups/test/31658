simpl.  first, andrew is correct, although i can see where there might be

some confus.  it is inde possibl to have two card *configur* to us

the same interrupt.  thei can not *share* the interrupt in the sens that it

is not possibl to have both card activ at the same time.



here is an exampl.  for some time, i wa short of "free interrupt."  i had a

tape control (not a "floppi tape") that need on of irq0-irq7.  (it's an

*old* tape drive.)  my solut wa to us irq3 (also us for com2, where my

modem is).  i did thi becaus i reason i would never be us the modem and

the tape simultan.  when kermit run, it instal it own interrupt

handler for irq3 and us the serial port.  if the tape drive were to gener

an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape

control.  (and sinc the tape control would not be servic, it would

most like "hang.")  likewis, when the tape backup softwar run, it

instal an interrupt handler for irq3.  that handler won't do anyth for

the serial port.



under do, print is not interrupt-driven.  instead, the bio poll the

statu of the parallel port to determin when anoth byte mai be sent.

that's why you can have your sound card and lpt1 both configur to us irq7.

try that on nt and see how far you'll get. :-)
