i went out and bought the pa16 yesterdai, and instal it into my gatewai

dx2-66v. i follow the instruct and set the sb side with dma 1 and irq5

(the default) and then the pa side with dma 5 and irq 10. my question is how

should i configur for mpu-401 compat. the manual and instal

program recommend irq2, but on my machin it is configur to [cascad] to

irq8-15. so can i still us irq2, or should i choos a differ on? right now

i have the mpu-401 emul mode turn off. actual what is thi "cascad to

irq8-15" busi?  



a relat question (to other gw or vl-bu machin owner) i wa told that 

onli dma 5, 6, 7 ar 16 bit dma, and 0-4 ar 8 bit dma. now what about

32-bit vl-bu master dma?? which dma channel(s) is us by the vl-bu

extens to do 32-bit dma?



yet anoth question, after instal pa16, my link (golf game) will hang

the machin when i select sb mode and run, but work with adlib mode??

civil howev work fine ( at least so far). ani bodi know what i might

have done wrong? 



thank (i am obvious a newbi) -- john
