help me with. i creat a window, and i want it to have some background color,

sai red, and draw an oval in it. further, when i resiz the window, i want

to be abl to redraw the imag so that is fill the new window (whether it

is larger or smaller.) im us aixwindow on an rs6000.



my problem is thi: when i resiz the window, onli the "origin" part of the

window that wa part of the window creation get drawn into. everyth els

is a grei..the oval "tri" to redraw itself but get clip. i can see that

it would be the right size if i could see all of it, but it onli show up in

the region that wa the origin size of the window when creat.



for exampl, i start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. if i

resiz it to 400x400, the onli part that ha ani color drawn into it is

is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grei. further the oval

onli show up in that 200x200 area.



what am i do wrong?? how can i get a window to resiz and redraw a 

re-scale imag in it to take up the full size of the window?
