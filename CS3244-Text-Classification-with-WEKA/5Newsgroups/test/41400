call-it a coupl month ago where thei announc that displai postscript wa

go to be includ in the next releas of sun's os, (presum solari.)

adob wa go to port illustr and photoshop to sun.  other than the

articl that appear in the trade journal immedi after, i haven't

heard a peep about it.  i hope it's still in the work.
