it's actual a bug in the solari 2.1 kernel. we could add a workaround to

xterm. open should never return einval, but it doe :-(



i didn't have time to updat the r5.suno5 patch late, but non

of the exist problem seem to warrant a new set of patch.

xdm coulda also keep the xdm environ variabl. it should have inherit
