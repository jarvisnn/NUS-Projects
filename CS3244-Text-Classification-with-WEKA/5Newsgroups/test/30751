hmmm... that's not quit right.  the performa 600 is real darn close

to the iivx (but a better bui imo).  i also don't think thei ar so

much a 'low-cost busi solut', but a low-cost _home_ solut.

why els bundl at eas (among other thing)?  hardli a busi

applic. 



what do you mean by 'no "retail price"'.  quit the contrari, i think.

the price is darn near the same all across the countri.  that (again,

imo) wa on of the sell point of the performa -- ie: no haggl

requir.  kinda like the saturn (car) of the comput set.  on

price, medium perform, readi to go.



when i shop for my performa (600cd), the differ between sear

(*sigh), montgomeri ward, silo (*sigh), circuit citi (*sigh*) and

bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  why i chose on over the

other wa base sole on avail and a friendli salesman who

went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someon who

sell appl?).  admittedli, except for montgomeri ward (and i

suspect i wa just lucki) all of the salesfolk i spoke to didn't know

didli about the comput, peece or mac.  but then, neither did ani

of the  appl dealer i spoke with...



if you would've told me a year ago that i would bui a macintosh from

montgomeri ward i woulda laugh for a long, long time.  go figur.

i'm *real* happi with my performa.  oh, and i bought the appl

performa plu monitor (vs. bui 3rd parti).  happi with that

decis as well.  i walk in, plop down some cash, and walk out

with a spankin' new comput the dai befor christma.
