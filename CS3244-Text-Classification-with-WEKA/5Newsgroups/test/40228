second, or 18.2 time a second) to time peopl's respons time, in a

psycholog experi, and the respons time ar on the order of .01

second. is there ani wai i can get better precis than by count

tick? or can i make the tick occur more frequent? i'm try to do

thi in do 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if thi could also work

on our old 8086 machin run do 2.1 (i know, i know, i don't like

them ani more than you do) but thi is by no mean a requir, just a

possibl. 

    so, basic, ani inform on the bio tick scheme and the

relat inrterruot would be appreci, as well as ani inform on

altern wai of improv accuraci. email is prefer, as i'm

plan on post thi to a few board, and i don't read all of them.
