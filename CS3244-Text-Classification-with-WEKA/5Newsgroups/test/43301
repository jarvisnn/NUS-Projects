i have done thi befor, but i'm not sure i us the best approach (although

i tri sever method...).



you have to run up the window heirarchi (us xquerytre()) until you get

to the root window.  now, thi is not so simpl becaus some window manag

slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,

so be sure to take that into account for further calcul.



calcul the posit and width/height offset for each window us

xgetgeometri().  be sure to take the border_width into consider.

rememb a window border_width is on the outsid of a window, so the

window x,y,width,height must be adjust accordingli.



all of thi should give you pretti good number for how much space the

window-manag is us.



now, to place the new window, you have to us the same number to calcul 

where you want to place it, becaus the window-manag will re-parent it on

the outsid of where you place your window (if i rememb correctli).



disclaim: all of thi is from memori, and i no longer have the code.  but

i did get it work under sever window manag correctli.  feel free to

call or e-mail for further info.
