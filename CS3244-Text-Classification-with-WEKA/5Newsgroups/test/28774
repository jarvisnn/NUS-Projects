hi.



he need insert the mo befor fileshar get turn on, and the onli on

that can see the disk is the owner of the machin. (i'm not sure but seem

that the check "allow owner to see entir disk" should be enabl too).



a bad thing: you can't eject the disk until fs is turn off.



hope that help.
