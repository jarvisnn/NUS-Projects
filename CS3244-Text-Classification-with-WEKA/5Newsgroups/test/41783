    the irq and interfac-select jumper ar pretti straightforward, but i

    don't grok the set of w10-w18 (also label a15 through a18).

    could somebodi tell me which set of these four jumper correspond

    to what i/o address?

    

the u-b pcnic (also oem by ibm for a while) is the onli ethernet card i

know of that doesn't us i/o address.  it onli ha interrupt and share

memori.  the jumper you see control bit 15-18 in the base address of the

share memori.  i can't recal which is 1 and which 0, but that's easi

to determin with debug.
