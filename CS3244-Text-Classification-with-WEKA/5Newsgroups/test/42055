i have a logitech 256grai hand scanner from a pc.  i'm wonder if anyon

ha been success in connect the scanner to a mac?  it ha the same

connector and is a serial devic on the pc.  i can imagin the pin conigur would need to change, but i'm not sure if the signal level would be correct,

and if the mac s/w would work with it.  



of cours the manual sai noth about the interfac, connector layout or

anyth h/w-ish!



ani idea??





thanx,



steve
