 a few week ago i saw an ad in the german magazin c't

about a so-call videostream. thi is an interfac

between a pc's parallel port and ani video-record for

back up your data on a videotap. the compani (datasav?)

claim that it can store up to 7 gb on a 300 minut tape.

                         ^^^^^^^^^^



it cost dm 250.- (about usd 200, i think)



my question is:

 doe anybodi us thi product, if ye, how mani byte 

 realli fit on a 300 minut tape (7 gb sound quit

 unbeliev to me). 



howev, ani comment on the interfac ar appreci.

pleas mail your repli directli to me, i will sum up

if neccesari. thank in advanc...
