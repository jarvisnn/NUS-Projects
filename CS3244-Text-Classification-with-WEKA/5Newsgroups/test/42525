it's the applic that do thi.  unfortun, even the applet

that ship with win31 seem to have thi problem (i've seen it in

solitair, for exampl).

none that i know of.  if an applic doesn't give back the

resourc, thei ar lost and gone forev, pend a restart of

window.

don't), there's bugger all that ani other piec of softwar can do

about it.

there ar book written on thi on.  in gener, just be sure to free

up everyth that you ask for befor you exit.  unfortun, i

understand that vb will *intern* lose resourc for you, so

there's no wai to avoid thi entir.
