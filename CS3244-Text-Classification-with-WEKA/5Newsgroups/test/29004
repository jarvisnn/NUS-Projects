do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the do displai and then back or 

creat a temp. do window?



if ye then i might recommend winzip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  i'm afraid 

i don't have the file name or version but you should be abl to find it.



it's fulli compat with ver. 2.04g and veri function.



later,
