i've recent re-upload to cica the current (v2.8) version of the work 

model of microc origin, a scientif and technic 2d/3d graphic and data 

analysi packag for window 3.x. the work model is 2d onli and put a

promo messag on hardcopi, but is larg ident to the full version.

save origin file is disabl, but you can save ascii data set produc

with origin. it also sai it ha an expir date of sept. 1, 1993.



try it. you mai like it, as i do!



it's current at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.17) in the directori

/pub/pc/win3/upload as origin2.zip. the file origin.zip is, unfortun,

incomplet (sorri 'bout that!).
