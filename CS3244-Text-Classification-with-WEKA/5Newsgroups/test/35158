   wasn't the sharewar fee a "suggest" by john?

   is so then it's up to the individu to make the choic whether or not to

   honour it and part with monei.  person if i wa in hi posit i would

   do exactli the same thing, john ha obvious put in lot of time and effort

   into xv and why shouldn't he receiv some monei for it.



it is interest to look at the chang(s) of mind that john ha had.

as follow...

  remain on it somewher...  other than that, it mai be freeli modifi,

  distribut, and us to fill up disk space.

  email messag to that effect.  be sure to mention the full name of your

  also, if you find xv to be nifti, us, gener 'cool', and of

  some valu to you, your donat (not tax-deduct) would be greatli

  appreci.  $10 (u.s.) is probabl a fine amount to donat.

  folk who donat $25 and up will receiv a nice, bound copi of the xv manual

  print on a spiffo 600-dpi laser printer.  it'll look love mount over

  your fireplac.

  larger donat ar quit welcom.  folk who donat $25 or more

  can receiv a print, bound copi of the xv manual for no extra

  charg.  if you want on, just ask.  be sure to specifi the version

  of xv that you ar us!
