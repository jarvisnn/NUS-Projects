it is true that the man page for pageview doe not sai that the file need

to be dsc compliant.  that is the fault of the left hand not know what the

right hand is do at sun.  i wa inform by a sun employe that the pageview

program doe requir dsc compliant postscript.  there wa the possibl that

it wa go to be chang so that if the file wasn't dsc compliant that it

would stop at each showpag.  i believ that thi method would preclud be

abl to go backward and forward through the file, i.e., you could onli go

forward to the next showpag.  thi isn't in ow3.0 pageview, but mayb it is

in the solari 2.x version of ow (ow 3.1?).



in ani event, i find pageview extrem us.  sinc all of the postscript

that i produc is dsc compliant, i don't have ani problem.
