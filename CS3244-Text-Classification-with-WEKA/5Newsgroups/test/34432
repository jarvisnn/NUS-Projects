thi mai work, but won't it involv invok the applic, e.g. if you

drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. print manag icon, won't it run

notepad and paintbrush befor print?  if you just want to drag a file

(.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stai at front attribut, you

need an intellig print manag drag and drop client like amish print 2.0.
