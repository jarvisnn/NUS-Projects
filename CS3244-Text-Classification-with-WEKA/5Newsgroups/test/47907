well, i thought that highmem.sy would do that too. i just took out emm386  

of my config.sy, and i'm still load my other driver high (mous, vga  

shadow bio, do-kei etc.) i haven't check mem/c, but i believ i have  

manag to load them high (ie between 640kb and 1024kb).



also, ever sinc i took out emm386, window load slightli faster, i get  

about 3 extra meg of freemem in window (i'm run 386 enhanc with 4  

meg ram, 7 meg swap) and i got rid of my ctrl-alt del reboot problem  

(befor, the comput would not reboot us ctrl-alt-del after exit  

window). 



i would realli like to keep emm386 out of my config.sy. anybodi els have  

info on thi???
