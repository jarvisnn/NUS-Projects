we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstat.  i wa also

shock when i first realiz that you have to offset line from fill by

about 16 bit (assum 24 bit z buffer).  thi seem huge, but is onli

1/256 of the dynam rang.  in those term it doesn't seem so bad.  what

is happen is that the interpol in z is not total linear, due

mainli to roundoff, i believ.  so the polygon is not planar in z, but is

more like a ruffl potato chip.  ditto with line.  when you start/end at

differ x/y valu, the "ridg" ar out of phase, result in the

stitch effect.  you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon

right on top of anoth, but with differ vertic.  you will like see

a smear effect where thei overlap.

  exampl:

  try polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)

      polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)



your implement is correct.  in fact, we do a similar trick when

render primit that have line and polygon - such as nurb surfac

with isoparametr line.  without the trick, the line appear stitch, as

you sai.  when the applic draw line/polygon independ, the

system doe not have the smart to automat do the z shift, so the

applic must do it.  thi is what you have discov and ar do.

bravo!



(note to ibm'er:  the inform given here ha been previous disclos

through proper channel so i'm not give awai ani new unpublish info.)
