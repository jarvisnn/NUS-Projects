gcc and other big program seem to crash about 15% of the time for me.

gcc gave someth like "program as got fatal signal 11" and when do

anyth past the complex of elvi, kermit, etc, i got kernel gener

protect fault at *least* onc a session.



i disabl my cach as suggest, and bingo, linux is as stabl as a rock

(it hasn't given me a core dump or kernel error yet).



doe ani on know why the cach would do someth like thi?
