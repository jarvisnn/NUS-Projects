you ar stuck in a distribut system feedback loop!  what if you ar on an

xtermin or run xterm over the net to anoth machin?  that is when the

load problem occur.  if you had a machin with 20 xtermin attach and

thei all had blink cursor in xterm's, thi could repres a consider

ethernet bandwidth wast.



i'm not pick on you, just peopl keep forget that there is a lot of life

out there besid distribut or singleus "workstat"!
