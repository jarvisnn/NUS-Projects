   i wa wonder if anyon know of a graphic packag for the pc that

   will do composit of a seri of pictur?



   what i mean by "composit" is, sai i have a live video clip

   (digit) pan around a live room, and a comput-gener

   bird fly around the screen.  i want to combin these two seri of

   pictur so that everywher where the bird frame ar black, i want

   the live room pictur to show through.  ye, i realiz i can do thi

   with a genlock, and i do own a genlock, but i want to be abl to do

   manual composit also.  it's ok if i have to composit on frame at

   a time; i assum i'd have to do that anywai.  but be abl to

   composit a seri of frame would be even better.



   i've look around and i haven't found a pc packag that will perform

   thi.  help, pleas!



if you can get the live anim and the comput-gener anim

into autodesk anim .fli or .flc format, autodesk anim will do

thi for you.  it can take on anim, make a certain color

"clear", and overlai it over anoth anim.  i do not have a wai

right now to convert .avi or .mpg file to anim file.  anim

will also import a seri of .gif file to creat an anim, so if

your video captur stuff can creat thi is might work.
