it seem that there ar a lot of question regard the cyrix 386 compat

486dlc and 486dru2.  my info come directli from cyrix's fast fax servic:

and also from instal on of these chip in an ibm model 80.



the 486dlc is a 486 instruct set compat cpu which fit into a 386dx

socket (pin grid arrai, or pga).  the dlc current is avail in 3 speed.

the 25, the 33, and the 40.  thei do not have a coprocessor on board, but ani

softwar queri will return coproc as present.  i guess thei emul the

coproc instruct.  math function ar on the 386dx level without the

actual coprocessor.



the intern cach on the 486dlc is 1k.  cyrix literatur claim a 85% hit

rate.  my inform test show that the cach account for a 10% perform

boost when it is enabl by softwar.  overal perform boost from a

386dx-25 to a 486dlc-25 is about 60%.  the benchmark i us were nu si and

qaplu dhryston and whetston.  the perform, with the cach enabl,

is about on a par with my 386dx-40 with 256k extern cpu cach, which is

around the perform for a 486sx-25.  the comput run noticebl faster,

and do 6 with dblspace is not complain.  the compani claim os/2

compat, but i didn't test it.



the 486dru2 is not a chip, as commonli thought.  the 486dru2 is actual

a small daughterboard slightli larger than the 386dx, which contain

the logic to manag the clock doubler.  thi board plug into the 386dx

pga, and the 486dlc-33 or 40 plug into thi board.  i guess the board

doubl the frequenc appar to the cpu, and insert wait state when 

access to the rest of the system is requir.  there ar no info avail

from cyrix there.  anywai, the dru2 is avail for 386dx-16, and 386dx-20

onli.  doubl these clock rate, and you get the 32mhz and the 40mhz dlc.

if cyrix is plan to do the same thing for the dru2-50, then thei need

to put out the 50mhz dlc2 first...



i also test a dlc33 motherboard, along with a cyrix coprocessor.  with 64k

extern cach, perform were about 30% faster than the 25, but still

significantli (25%?) slower than an actual intel 486dx.



imho, the dlc is a great, low price upgrad for peopl who can't afford, or

can't instal, a new motherboard.  it is definit worth what i paid for it,

but if you need 486dx-33 perform, the dlc33 won't cut it.  i'm not sure

about the dlc-40, but i think even if it match the perform, it won't

beat it in ani signific wai.



the last time i post info about the dlc, peopl sent quit a bit of mail,

ask where i got it.  so here is where i got mine:



treasur chest peripher, thei advertis in the comput shopper.

1-800-677-9781

the 486dlc-25 kit wa $179.00



but....



i like the chip so much that i found the supplier, and becam a dealer.

if you ar interest in the chip, e-mail me, and i can fax or mail you

more info.   i'm well awar of the net's polici against commerci us,

so i can;t post anymor info here.  howev, if there ar more question

regard the 486dlc itself, i'll post what i can.
