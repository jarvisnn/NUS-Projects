: in other word, it is your *opinion* that msw3.1 is inferior to it

: competit.  that's not the same as msw3.1 be object inferior.



no.  it is technic inferior to the os/gui that i list.  i have alreadi

describ why.  to sai briefli:



system 7 --easier to learn and us.  there have been independ studi to 

           that effect.

os/2     --can run msw applic and ha more stabl multitask.

nextstep --easier to learn, us, and program. more stabl multitask

unix/x   --as easi to learn and us.  more stabl multitask.



with the prpoer setup, all of these will exchang data with msw machin as

well as msw machin will amongst themselv, so interoper is not

an issu.



by thi criterion, it is inferior.  if you have anoth, then perhap i am

incorrect.  do you pick up the glove?
