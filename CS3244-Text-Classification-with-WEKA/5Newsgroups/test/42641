we ar talk about a scsi-1 devic (e.g. hd) on a scsi-2 control.



here is a rewrit of my mac & info sheet scsi section:

scsi: onli extern devic expans interfac common to both mac and ibm.

 allow the us of ani devic: hard drive, printer, scanner, nubu card 

 expans {mac plu onli}, some monitor, and cd-rom.  normal {asynchron}

 scsi is 5 mhz;  fast {synchron} scsi is 10 mhz.  differ between these

 mode is mainli in the softwar driver.

 main problem:  there ar a lot of extern devic which ar intern 

 termin which caus problem for more then two devis off the scsi port 

 {a scsi chain is suppos to be termin onli at the begin and end. 

 ani other set up caus problem for either mac or ibm}. 

scsi-1:  8-bit; 7 devic per scsi control.  asynchron {~1.5mb/s av}

 and synchron {5mb/s max} transfer.  8-bit scsi-2 is often mistaken for

 a fast version of scsi-1 {see scsi-2 for detail}.

scsi-2: fulli scsi-1 compliant. scsi-2 mode - 10 devic per scsi control.

 8-bit scsi-2 is impliment as a veri fast scsi-1 sinc it can run us

 scsi-1 hardwar and softwar driver which limit it to 7 devic, which

 result in it sometim be mistakenli consit part of scsi-1.  16-bit

 and 32-bit scsi-2 requir differ port, electron, and scsi softwar

 driver from scsi-1 {which make them more expens than other scsi

 interfac}.  32-bit scsi seem to run onli in synchron mode, henc term

 'wide and fast scsi' transfer speed ar 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst {8-bit},

 8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst

 {32-bit}.



8-bit scsi-2 is the biggest headach due to the fact that it is the onli scsi-2 

that i know of that can pump scsi-2 speed through scsi-1 devic and softwar

control.  it main impliment is on the mac though you do see add

for scsi-2 at 10mb/s maximum throughput for pc.  sinc 8-bit scsi-2 doe not

need all the hardwar {includ electon} and softwar of 16-bit and 32-bit

scsi-2 it is the cheepest of the scsi-2 interfac.  just pop out the scsi-1

electorn and pop in 8-bit scsi-2 electron.  some peopl consid

16-bit where scsi-2 realli start {i us to be on of them} but

4-6mb/s averag though put with a theoret burst of 10mb/s is not scsi-1

but is 8-bit scsi-2.

rule of thumb: if it is scsin and over 5mb/s then it is some type of scsi-2.



8-bit scsi can us part of scsi-1 electron which further reduc it cost

compar to 16 and 32-bit scsi-2.
