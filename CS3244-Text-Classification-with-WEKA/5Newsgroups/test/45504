repost - due to net problem



hi,

   i have problem with the fdhd on a iicx that ekg report is rom

revis 376. i had report that thi mac wa have troubl 

format disk and by the time i got to it, the fdhd just would

not respond although all other function were fine.



i check the voltag on the db19 extern drive connector and pin

6 show no volt with 7 and 8 give 25volt unload. the power 

suppli is an astec and i sent it awai for repair.



with the power suppli reinstal, i now get the follow error:



with the intern fdhd connect, the mac boot fine but on complet

of boot cycl an alert displai "the disk is unread - do you

want to eject it?". for everi combin of respons, the alert 

reappear within approx 2 second and thi error is continu. the

fdhd doe spin but there is no head seek and the fdhd is incap

of eject the disk. thi error sequenc occur regardless of whether

there is a floppi in the drive or not. pin 6 on the db19 extern 

connector show 1.2v, pin 7 and 8 show 10.75v.



with the intern fdhd disconnect, the mac boot fine and work great 

(macekg report no error). the db19 extern connector now show

no voltag on pin 6 but pin 7 and 8 show 10.75v.



now, the intern fdhd mai be fubar, but i have an appl 800k extern

drive that give exactli the same symptom as the intern drive when

connect to either the extern db19 or the intern connector at j16

(after suitabl surgeri to the extern drive). the voltag at j16 

(with the intern fdhd disconnect) ar as follow:



	pin	volt	pin	volt

	1	-	2	5

	3	-	4	5

	5	-	6	5

	7	-	8	-

	9	-	10	5

	11	-	12	-

	13	10.75	14	5

	15	10.75	16	5

	17	10.75	18	-

	19	10.75	20	5



thi machin ha a swim which i don't think ekg test. i have test all

diod and pica fuse and can find no problem. doe anybodi have ani

idea ?

                          woodi.
