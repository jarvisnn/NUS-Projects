	help,



	i've got an applic with a seri of pushbutton across

	the top (a toolbar).  i want to add eventhandl to these

	pushbutton on enterwindowmask and leavewindowmask so that

	i can put up some descript text about the function of each

	pushbutton as the pointer cross over it.



	i've done thi fine, but i've turn up the follow problem:



	when the pushbutton ar sensit i get callback on both of

	the abov event, but when thei ar not sensit i onli get

	callback on leavewindow event.  thi seem odd.  i would

	expect thi to be an all-or-noth type of thing.



	is thi a bug?  if not, can someon explain thi behavior?



	thank,



	mark
