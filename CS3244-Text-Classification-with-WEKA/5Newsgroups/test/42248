*** on 04-21-93  04:30, michael shapiro had the unmitig gall to sai thi:



 ms> the do system date ha a twenti-four hour clock and a rollov bit.

 ms> when the system cross midnight, the rollov bit is turn on.  

 ms> subsequ read of the time add on.  there's no chang possibl



 ms> (thi inform wa current up through do 3.3.  i've not check to

 ms> see whether it appli to later version.)



just a small tidbit: with the advent of do 3.3 and later version, ms ad

a small "featur" to the do time function.  if a program set the do clock

via do system servic, then do will set the bio clock to the same valu.

thi break the isol between the two clock that us to ensur that

error in the do clock did not bleed over into the bio clock.



sometim the microsoft peopl just don't think! :)



... fact:  mickei mous wear a al gore wristwatch.
