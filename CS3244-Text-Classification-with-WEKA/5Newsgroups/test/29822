hi:



i need some advic (opinion?) regard which pc would best suit my need!

i want to us thi (propos) beast for basic four thing:  



     -	edit document us wordperfect 5.1 (under do)



     -	creat graph/analyz data us sigmaplot v5.0 (under do)



     -	edit/plai with imag us aldu photostyl, run under 

	window 3.1 - these imag can be larg, sai 2k x 2k, 24bit/pixel



     -	us the pc as an xtermin, run desqview/x 1.1 and sun pc-nf, 

	talk to our network of sparcstat's - thi is where a lot of

	the imag/data come from, and is the most demand of these task.



i've read, read, read pc magazin, perform benchmark, read thi newsgroup,

and decid that a "nice" system (price/perform) would be:



	486dx-50 256k cach, isa, vlb, 16meg ram

	ati graphic ultra pro, 2 meg ram, local bu

	15" monitor, 1280x1024 ni

	3com etherlink iii 16bit

	maxtor 240mb id hard drive



howev, the part don't fit!  our local retail appar put on of these

togeth, onli to discov that the ati card wouldn't run at 50mhz - surpris

surpris.  actual, after read thi group, i'm surpris that thei even

have a 50mhz local bu run...



i have a choic now between basic the abov system but with a

486dx2-66 with isa and vlb,  or,   a 486dx-50 with eisa and no vlb (and thu

the non-local bu version of the ati card).  which is better, keep in mind

that i'm primarili interest in the last two task?  



ani help would be greatli appreci!  (i need to decid quickli, so ani 

speedi help would be appreci even more!!)







btw: we have a system now to perform these task, it ha the follow 

configur:



	486dx-33 64k cach, isa, 8 meg ram

	ati graphic ultra+, 2 meg ram

	14" monitor, 1024x768 ni

	smc ethercard 8 bit

	maxtor 120mb id hard drive



we're quit happi with the ati card - veri fast, onc the data get to it!!

~slow~ repaint imag under photostyl that have move off screen, or

been uncov!  



there doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when run desqview/x!  it sluggish

run the local window manag.  also, mani function under photostyl take

a long time (even when the imag fit entir in ram).



there's not enough memori in the system - desqview/x and a 1 meg smartdriv

don't leav much room for other app.  photostyl will page to disk with

medium size imag.



i have perform a number of benchmark on the ethernet transfer rate.  thi

machin sustain onli 120k/sec over ethernet while our sparc sustain 600k/sec 

on the same network.  go to the 16 bit version of the smc card increas

transfer rate to 160k/sec - still veri slow (especi when move larg 

imag).  is there such a thing as a local-bu ethernet card come??  will it

make a differ?  i'm hope so, and lean toward the 486dx2-66 choic 

(abov), for that reason.



also, ar there dx2-100's on the horizon?  what about dx3-99's?  dx3-150's ???!



ani inform is greatli appreci.
