why would you dispos a channel if you ar go to plai more

sound soon? if you ar try to write a game, you shouldn't

be us sndplai. instead, make a channel and us buffercmd

to plai sound on it. it work great. you can add callback to

the channel also to let you know when the channel is get

empti. befor it get empti.

callback ar veri reliabl, i found them 100% reliabl, even

under system 4.1. i wa do continu background sound with

interrupt sound effect on system 6.0 with the im-v

document.



you probabl were cancel your callback command out of

your channel, of cours you didn't get call. in gener, if

you have problem with sound work when you plai on per

channel and then close the channel (with the relat

slowdown), but then when you plai more than on you don't

work, then you ar ad more than on synthes to a

channel, possibl the same on multipl time. thi might be

becaus you ar call sndplai on a preexist channel with

a sound resourc which add the sampl sound synthes to

the channel first thing befor it plai. most sampl sound

have thi command at the start of them. you need to resedit

the sound and remov that command, then when you creat your

channel, specifi the sampl sound synthes to be the

channel's synth. then you can us asynch sndplai's all you

want. you'll probabl want to switch to buffercmd's, sinc you

ar go to have to us snddocommand anywai to add callback.



now befor you go ahead and tell me i am full of it, and the

sound manag doesn't work for game, rememb, spectr us

it. and it work great. if spectr can spare the cpu time, you

can too.



on littl disclaim: there ar some out there who sai the

sound manag in the iisi can't be made to work right. i'm not

sure either wai, but i know for sure that you can make your

sound work 100% correctli on everi other machin us the

sound manag.
