i don't have my copi of the manual with me right now, but i can offer the

follow in the interim:



   1)  the card us port address 0x2e0 and 0x2e8 (which ar not

       configur).  these address, incident, were inadvertantli

       omit from my version of the manual.



   2)  i believ there is a dip that control whether or not to enabl

       irq 2 (for cga or ega support??!?).
