sound to me like your dealer realli want to get rid of the iivx's he ha in

stock.  i can imag that thei ar get hard to sell, given that 

 1. a c610 is wai faster, and is compar in price.

 2. an lciii is about the same speed, and is wai cheaper.

so your dealer mai well be try as hard as he can to convinc peopl

that iivx's ar a much better bui than a c610 just so he can get rid of all

hi old stock!



no disrespect to dealer or the iivx intend!
