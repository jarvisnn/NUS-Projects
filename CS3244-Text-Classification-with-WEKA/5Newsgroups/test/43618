okai, i got enough repli about the kubota kenai/denali system that i

will post a summari of their capabl.  i haven't actual us on

or seen on, so take the spec with a grain of salt.  i'd like to see

an independ review of on against, sai, an sgi indigo extrem or

someth.



basic, the kenai workstat ar dec alpha axp base workstat that

run osf/1 ( dec's ) and will like run window nt in the futur.  thei ar

binari compat with digit's osf/1 alpha axp implement.  denali

is their graphic subsystem, which is upgrad in the field by

simpli ad "transform engin".



the two main kenai machin ar the 3400 imag and 3d graphic workstat

and the 3500 imag and 3d graphic workstat.

okai, now the real stuff.  the kenai station work with a graphic architectur

known as denali.  the denali come in three model, the e, p, and v.  thei

us a decchip 21064 superscalar risc processor at 150mhz.  their

capabl ar as follow:

as you can see, these ar pretti power workstat, and the best part

is the price.  i would recommend that you call kubota for more inform.

their number is 408-727-8100.  i'm sure thei'll send you an inform you

mai want.  oh, some price:



low-end



kenai 3400, e seri w/ 1 tem and 5 fbm --- 27,795 dollar u.s.

kenai 3500, e seri w/ 1 tem and 5 fbm --- 45,345 dollar u.s.



high-end



kenai 3400, v seri w/ 6 tem and 20 fbm -- 61,795 dollar u.s.

kenai 3500, v seri w/ 6 tem and 20 fbm -- 79,345 dollar u.s.



if someon could post a rel comparis with an indigo extrem or

someth i would appreci it.



hope thi help someon out there,



brian



ps i am not affili with kubota in ani wai.  hell, i thought thei made

tractor or someth. :-)
