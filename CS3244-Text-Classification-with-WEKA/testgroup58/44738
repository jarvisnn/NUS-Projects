hello,



i saw thi question post a week or so ago, but as far as i could tell no

answer appear on the net. what is the good oil on connect the appl

extend keyboard to a powerbook? the earlier question wonderd if thi would

be too much of a load for the pb and as i want to connect just such a beast i

am curiou.



i haven't got a pb yet so i can't rtfm but i assum that a standard keyboard

with a mous would be ok as the spec sheet i read mention connect an

extern keyboard. but is the extend plu mous push it?



ani help gratefulli reciev. i will summaris to the net if necessari.



thank, john collin.



p.s. i am think of a pb160 but i assum that thi would appli to all pb's.
