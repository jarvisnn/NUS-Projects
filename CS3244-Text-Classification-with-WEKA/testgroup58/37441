i've been us window nt (tm) sinc the octob releas, and i have to 

sai that the march releas is realli a big improv.  window nt (tm)

is becom usabl.



there ar a few thing to consid befor you make the leap though.

first (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed do box.

what i mean is, i cannot (for instanc) run falcon 3.0 or ani other

resours intens program in a do box.  it absolutlei crawl.  

and my machin is a 486/33 with a 330mb hd and 16mb ram.  if anyon

know how to get a fast do box (or full-screen for that matter), 

pleas let me know.



the second thing is there ar still not mani driver around for stuff.

for instanc, my pa-16 ha been demot to run as a sound blaster

(which is nativ support -- nice), becaus mediavis hasn't 

produc driver yet.



your disk should be larg enough to keep an 80mb do partit, and

give the rest over to window nt (tm).  the onli thing is, whenev

you want to run window program, you'd have to reboot and log into

window nt (tm), instead of just type win.



window nt (tm) doe seem to be much more stabl than normal window

though.  it'd be a good choic if you have the resourc.  you should

realli have *at least* 8mb ram though.  on last thing, modem work

well enough, but i have yet to get my fax card to work, and i've never

heard of anyon els who did either.



it's onli better than unix becaus it run killer softwar out of the

box, wherea with unix there isn't the same availabl.



i guess it come down to -- window nt (tm) is not yet for the faint

of heart, it's still a beta.  but it's a veri good beta.
