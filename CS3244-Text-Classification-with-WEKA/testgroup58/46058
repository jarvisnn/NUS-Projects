call phoenix.  thei can put you on line with replac bio chip.  i had

to do thi when i upgrad a emerson 386/20 to an id drive.



also, if you ar instal an id drive, and there is a bio set that

ha a total volum the same as the id drive's volum, try us it.  the

id drive can usual respond to a varieti of differ geometri, as long

as the set that you us is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual

size.  the control will do the necessari translat automat, in

most case.



warn!!!  do not us a bio set that is even on byte larger than the

actual size of the drive!  a smaller set will not harm the drive, but

you will be sorri if you go even on byte over.  drive damag will not

result, but headach will!
