	sever wai ar avail -- pageview (which i think came

with our system, so i can't point), ghostview (with ghostscript), and

the new xv 3.00 packag all do so.  i recommend the latter two,

especi xv if you want to do ani convers.

	i'm not sure offhand, but i will attempt to mail you the

comp.lang.postscript faq, which ha a list of util.
