can anyon tell me the procedur for hook a person laserwrit ntr

serial to a mac?  the document sai it can be done, but i'm not sure of

the correct switch set to us out of the given non-appletalk switch

option.  also, will i need to instal a new driver so that the chooser know

the printer is hook up directli (not network)?



thank a lot,

ross
