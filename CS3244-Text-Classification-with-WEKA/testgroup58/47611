i have a 486 dx 33 motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up. 

i'd rather not replac the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know

if i can us a dx/2 66mhz cpu. the bio is late model ami, circa 1991,

and the system crystal is approx 66.3mhz. 



my question is, can i just replac the origin 33mhz cpu with the new

dx/2 cpu? if it possibl, will there be a need for extra cool

devic such as heatsink and / or muffin fan??
