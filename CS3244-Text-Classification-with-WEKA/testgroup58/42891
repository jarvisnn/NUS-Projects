there ar some trick to instal atm to window... instal them first

to do, then run the atm control panel to get them into window.



the best reason for atm is that adob is the standard.  truetyp is a

fail ms ventur to undercut adob when adob wa be nasti about

keep their format proprietari.  just about ani servic bureau or print

shop will smirk and send you on your wai if you bring a truetyp document

to them for high resolut print or rip.



although there ar lot of pretti tt font float around, thei ar realli

for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.

howev, you can convert your tt font with fontmong or some similar program

to atm font for high end stuff.



if you ar us dot matrix for all your print, you mai have wast

your monei!
