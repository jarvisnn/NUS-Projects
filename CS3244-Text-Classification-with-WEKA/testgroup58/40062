if you instal x lib xt by redefin projectroot, you will find that

 dure the instal it recompil on of the file in x lib that doe the

search for xkeysmdb and emb the search path for the file base on whatev

projectroot wa defin. to confirm thi what happen, becaus i'm 

guess, go to mit/lib/x and do

string xstrkeysym.o | egrep xkeysymdb
