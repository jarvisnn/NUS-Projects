subject: program to displai .gif file?

line: 17



it seem silli, but while i've locat thing like tgif that can  edit

gif  file, and variou tool to convert to/from gif format, i haven't

been abl to locat a program that just open a window and displai  a

gif file in it.  i've look thru variou faq file, also to no avail.

is there on lurk about in some  archiv?   noth  sophist;

just "show the pretti pictur"?



altern, if i could locat the spec for gif, i don't suppos it

would be too hard to write it myself, but i have no idea where to even

start look for the spec.  (well, actual, i do have an idea - thi

newsgroup.  ;-)

if the auto industri were like the comput industri, a car would  now

cost $5, would get 5000 mile to the gallon, and at random time would

explod, kill all it passeng.
