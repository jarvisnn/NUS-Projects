don't be silli.



us the sound manag on a quadra is veri well, but us sm on

ani of the low-end machin doesn't simpli work for a decent action

game sinc it just steal too much time from the cpu. thi is

a fact. by write directli to the hardwar on an se, it is

possibl to have 4 simultan channel of sampl sound (11khz) for

a cost of approx. 8000 cycl. exactli how would you do that us

the sm, prai tell?



the correct thing to do is to us the sm on the machin that can

carri that extra load us the sm mean, and to write directli

to the sound hardwar on the machin that can't. it's not the

polit correct thing, but from the develop' point of

view it is.
