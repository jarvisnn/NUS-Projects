last week's macweek articl by ric ford indic that david ramsei's

mac iix ha been run nice with a mac iici rom in it, offer

clean 32-bit rom code (liber hi iix from the virtual memori

nightmar caus by appl's 32-bit system enabl).



doe anyon know of a sourc for these rom?  is it okai for a

remanufactur to resel onli rom chip from us machin?  i know that

copi cannot be made, but it seem to me that it would be okai to

resel the origin us rom.  (after all, resel a us comput

involv the sale of the rom anywai, so what's the differ?).



needless to sai, i'm interest in purchas such a rom.  what would

be a reason price to offer?
