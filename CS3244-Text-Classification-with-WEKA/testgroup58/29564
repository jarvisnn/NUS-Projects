	thi is on of the trickiest problem w/ win 3.1 ... person i run

telix 3.2 for do under window just fine (and 've been wait for the win

version froever... :) ), but i have to admit i am the except to the rule:

i have tri instal variou do comm prog on friend' machin, most of

them w/ big problem... some of the stuff you have to lookout for: 

1) alwai run the prog thru a .pif, never by call it .ex, 2) in the .pif

_alwai_ toggl on _lock_applic_memori_ --actual thi is someth

ms point out in the readm.wri file, and is especi critic for download

3) go under ctrl panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your com port 'alwai warn'

--it will help u w. debug thi thing and it's 'healthier' 4) check where

ar u run the mous from - com port - 5) check the com port address from

your bio setup and from ctrl panel/port/(setup?)/advanc..

these might help u... if yu still have problem, get $100 and bui procomm+win..,

:) hope it help somehow...
