thi is a bad idea. my machin is on 24 hour a dai, but it's actual 

_do_ thing 24 hour a dai. i us it as an all purpos alarm clock, 

schedul, i've got routin that run in the middl of the night, phone 

call it make dure the dai when i'm out. if your machin is _on_ 24 hour 

a dai, then you can count on it to be _work_ 24 hour a dai. i could call 

it from work and download a file that i might need, i could call it from 

work and have it turn the light on if i'm go to be late (oop, more 

wast electr -- but convers, i could have it turn the light 

_off_). heck, i suppos i could even connect the microwav and have dinner 

readi when i get there.



oh well. nevermind. i'm just babbl.
