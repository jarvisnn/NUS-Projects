i total agre with your friend, sinc when the cpu is appar idl

it is still in fact churn awai million of instruct per second

(check for keyboard input for instanc).  



the except to thi is for cpu's us in laptop, where the cpu can

enter an idl state where it is just preserv it current statu but

do absolut noth.  in thi case it need a hardwar interrupt

to get it go again.
