 i have a copi of 'the earth-from space' on my wall that i purchas

from space shot, inc. (la, ca  (800) 272-2779).  as print on the

poster, the imag wa creat by tom van sant and the geospher project.

the imag is copyright, so i doubt that you'll find it legal in

the public domain.  part of the proce from the sale of the imag go to the 

geospher project (an environment educ thing), and the cost is

nomin, so crack a 20 and bui on!  also, i don't think it's alwai

safe to assum that just becaus the govern 'fund' a project, ani

product will be provid for free.  mani govern agenc (nasa, noaa)

and some privat group (nation geograph) provid assist to the

geospher project.  thi collabor seem to be mostli orient to

educ the public, rather than pure research.
