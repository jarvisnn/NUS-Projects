microsoft is the largest softwar compani on the planet, yet i cannot think

of even *on* comput concept that thei innov and brought to market

befor anyon els.  xerox-parc/appl, osborn, next, gnu and other have 

been pioneer and led the wai to the futur of comput.  what ha

microsoft done to be a technolog leader?  i post thi question befor,

but i got nari a repli.  i make the challeng now to anyon who can come up

with someth-especi microsoft employe.  i get no respons thi time,

i guess it pretti much assur me that there is none--which is what i

suspect anywai.
