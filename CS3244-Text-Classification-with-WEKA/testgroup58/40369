hmm... 48 bit ay?

well, it beat a 32-bit design for thee sake of elleg.

48 bit mean 16 bit per primari colour.

the 2^48 nr of colour is a bit mislead. it make more sens to see it

as 65536 possibl shade of pure red.

thi might actual make some sens, sinc 256 shade of red (24 bit colour) 

mai produc visibl 'jump' in intens.

then again, a byte per primari colour for each pixel is the most eleg wai 

of do colour graphic, becaus it leav ya such a tidi (and fast) program

code.



	take care,
