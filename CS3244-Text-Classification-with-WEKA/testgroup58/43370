|      -	edit document us wordperfect 5.1 (under do)



|      -	creat graph/analyz data us sigmaplot v5.0 (under do)



|      -	edit/plai with imag us aldu photostyl, run under 

| 	window 3.1 - these imag can be larg, sai 2k x 2k, 24bit/pixel



|      -	us the pc as an xtermin, run desqview/x 1.1 and sun pc-nf, 

| 	talk to our network of sparcstat's - thi is where a lot of

| i've read, read, read pc magazin, perform benchmark, read thi newsgroup,

| 	486dx-50 256k cach, isa, vlb, 16meg ram

| 	ati graphic ultra pro, 2 meg ram, local bu

| 	15" monitor, 1280x1024 ni

| 	3com etherlink iii 16bit

| 	maxtor 240mb id hard drive



| howev, the part don't fit!  our local retail appar put on of these

| togeth, onli to discov that the ati card wouldn't run at 50mhz - surpris

| surpris.  actual, after read thi group, i'm surpris that thei even

| have a 50mhz local bu run...



| i have a choic now between basic the abov system but with a

| 486dx2-66 with isa and vlb,  or,   a 486dx-50 with eisa and no vlb (and thu

| the non-local bu version of the ati card).  which is better, keep in mind

| that i'm primarili interest in the last two task?  



have in mind the size of the imag, my opinion is to go with vlb.

it ha _much_ more bandwith that eisa, which in fact can be util

by the craphic card. (i have not made measur, so someon els mai

share experi on that.)



also, the dx2/66 is faster in the oper, that run off intern

cach, slightli slower off the extern and about the same off memori.

so my advic is the 66/vlb.



| we're quit happi with the ati card - veri fast, onc the data get to it!!

| ~slow~ repaint imag under photostyl that have move off screen, or

| been uncov!  



| there doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when run desqview/x!  it sluggish

| run the local window manag.  also, mani function under photostyl take

| a long time (even when the imag fit entir in ram).



| there's not enough memori in the system - desqview/x and a 1 meg smartdriv

| don't leav much room for other app.  photostyl will page to disk with

| medium size imag.



have you tri run photostyl without the cach? no need to have

page and cach both. (well, you might argu, that the page is

cach). my belief (no measur) is that app left with more

memori will manag it better than smartdrv.ex(sy).



| i have perform a number of benchmark on the ethernet transfer rate.  thi

| machin sustain onli 120k/sec over ethernet while our sparc sustain 600k/sec 

| on the same network.  go to the 16 bit version of the smc card increas

| transfer rate to 160k/sec - still veri slow (especi when move larg 

| imag).  is there such a thing as a local-bu ethernet card come??  will it

| make a differ?  i'm hope so, and lean toward the 486dx2-66 choic 

| (abov), for that reason.



the bandwidth (theoret) of isa is over 5mb/s, which is far from

0.15mb/s. i tri my isa id hard drive (maxtor 213mb) and got the

same result - 0.65mb/s - regardless of the isa bu speed

(5.5-8.25mhz). so i guess, that just the card/driver combin is

lousi.



| also, ar there dx2-100's on the horizon?  what about dx3-99's?  dx3-150's ???!



the rumor ar that dx3-99 (if ani) is the most like chip to come

out. but note, that ibm is closest to the technolog an it will onli

sell whole motherboard, so you'll have to upgrad the mb.



| ani inform is greatli appreci.



just some view, not much figur.
