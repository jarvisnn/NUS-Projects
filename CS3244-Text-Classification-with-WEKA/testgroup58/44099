if you read the last coupl of book in the seri close (well, #3 and #4

at least), there ar at least two point at which the real question is

impli.  convers proce much like:



zaphod: what *is* the ultim question, i wonder?

arthur (not pai much attent to zaphod, but need a random seed for

  the infinit improb drive): think of a number, ani number.



actual, it mai be marvin who us thi phrase a few time as well, and

everytim it's arrang such that "think of a number, ani number" could be

an answer to someon's question about the question.



i kind of like it.  veri mystifi.  it's not even "pick a number" or

"tell me a number", just "think of on".
