you don't give the precis error messag, but i assum that

the make of the target fail, becaus make can't find the rule.



we've seen thi happen with suno 5.x make as well and aat thi

point i'm not sure why it happen. it seem to happen

with larg makefil. the entri near the end get lost.

small chang in the makefil will remedi thi problem,

as it doe in your exampl.



in the mit r5 distribut + r5.suno5.patch thi can happen with

the target ``makefil'' in on of the doc directori.
