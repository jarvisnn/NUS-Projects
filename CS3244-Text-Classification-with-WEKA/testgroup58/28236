i don't know the specif of the compress algorithm, but i've us the

sharewar program, paintshop, to convert between the two.  you can download

it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but i don't know what the file is call

or what directori it is in (you can start by look in pub/pc/win3 or try

scan the index file).



to convert a .bmp file to a .rle file, you just load the .bmp file and do a

"save as..."  select "window bitmap" and "compress" (or is it "rle"?)

whatev it is, it's fairli intuit...



sorri i don't have all the detail, but i'm current on an ibm3151 dumb

termin and can't do much research...good luck!
