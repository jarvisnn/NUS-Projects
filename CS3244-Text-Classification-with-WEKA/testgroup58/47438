i have the follow problem on a dell 450se with the ati graphic ultra pro 

eisa:



when i start window, the first 5 time i try to run an applic, it doe

not start. window will show the follow error messag:



   error execut applic. there is not enough memori to run the    

   applic.



after the first 5 tri, the applic i want to run will start, and 

afterward there ar no more problem. when i chang the video driver from 

mach 32 to 8514/a, thi problem doe not occur, so i suspect the ati 

driver (i tri both the build 55 and build 59 driver).



doe anyon have a clue?
