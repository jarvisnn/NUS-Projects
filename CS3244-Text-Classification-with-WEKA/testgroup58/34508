hi all,



i've read the faq, i've fiddl around, but i am still have problem get

my poor old hp9000/300 to let me input/displai charact abov 127.  i have 

the follow in my .xdefault:



xterm*font     :   -adob-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1



so i believ that i have the correct font select to us in xterm.  i have not

set my lc_ctype environ variabl becaus whatev i put it, it tell me that

that local is not support (appar we have no addit local defin,

or at least, /lib/local doesn't exist).  i can get some of the charact

abov 127 to print out, but thei ar not where i'd expect them -- for exampl,

alt-v doe not produc a u umlaut.  thi lead me to believ that the fault

li with the stty set, which ar as follow:



speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>

intr = ^c; quit = ^\; eras = ^h; kill = ^k; swtch = ^@

eof = ^d; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^s; start = ^q

-parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crt 

-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc 

ixon -ixani ixoff -ienqak 

isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echo echok -echonl -noflsh 

opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofil -ofdel -tostop 



anywai, i've struggl with thi off and on for a coupl of week, and ani help

anyon could offer would be greatli appreci.





					thank!
