howdi...  i think you would be interest in infini-d 2.5 for the mac.  there

is no do or window version.  it's quit an amaz program.



"some" of the featur:



*  bevel text

*  timelin base anim sequenc

*  realtim bound box preview

*  object link

*  phong shade

*  rai trace

*  bound box shade

*  wirefram shade

*  ghourad shade

*  flat shade

*  anti-alias (none, low, medium, high)

*  environ map

*  quicktim support (wrap a qt movi around an object)

*  procedur surfac

*  compos surfac (for layer surfac)

*  alpha channel support

*  import ep, dxf, and swivel 3d file

*  export dxf and swivel 3d file

*  spline base anim

*  anim assist (for creat smooth movement and other stuff)

*  object morph (surfac and bevel morph too)



... and lot more that i can't rememb right now...



anywai, it's not as expens as some of the other anim/render

packag.  i think you can get it for around $699 from macwarehous.

thei also have educ discount...



well, hope that help a bit.
