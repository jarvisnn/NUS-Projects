sound like a memori conflict problem, which can caus truli weird symptom 

like these. call dell tech support (or better, post to them on cserv if you

have an account) and get the memori rang(s) us by video ram on your

machin. the block window from us those rang with an

emmexclud= statement in the 386enh section of system.ini. you probabl

should includ a statement exclud the same rang from emm386 or whatev

memori manag you us in config.sy.



dell "instal" window on the machin thei ship, but the instal doesn't

consist of much more than  copi the file to a hard disk. you still have

to do the work. and the fact that you have the problem in enhanc

mode but not standard strongli suggest a high memori conflict.
