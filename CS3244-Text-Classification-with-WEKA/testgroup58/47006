here is the latest on reloc your help file to a server.  

the winhelp() function, as i am told by ms, doe search your path so 

reloc ms window helpfil won't be a problem as long as you includ

the path to where you move them to, howev, if an applic ha 

hardcod the path into their code so that when winhelp is invok it

search the given path (i.e. winhelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for exampl) then

winhelp doe not search your path and instead look onli to that directori

where you have instal your softwar.



i test thi out on a varieti of softwar packag.  i move all my 

helpfil to the drive z:\ and includ thi in the path statement.

here is the result for differ softwar packag:





norton desktop			found helpfil

window v3.1 for workgroup	found helpfil

window v3.1			found helpfil

ms powerpoint v3.0		found helpfil

ms word				found helpfil

ms excel v4.0a			did not find helpfil (strang)

ms foxpro v2.5 for window	found helpfil

lotu amipro v3.0		did not find helpfil

procomm plu for window	did not find helpfil





i guess thi is better than noth but it would make sens to be abl to 

specifi a global path for helpfil.  



if anyon ha ani comment or if i can help anyon or if i left someth

out pleas let me know.
