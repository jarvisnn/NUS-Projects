           cornel theori center summer school

 

          offer through the cornel school of

        continu educ and summer session

 

                  cours descript

 

 within the past ten year, the  simul and  model of

line: 197



molecul ha evolv from an esoter academ subject into

a  intern  industri. comput  graphic ha plai  a

decis role in thi transform by allow chemist to

build, visual and interact with complex geometr object.

 

while comput scientist ar convers in the languag of their

own disciplin, thei ar often unfamiliar with the terminolog,

simul techniqu and practic need of research chemist.

similarli, chemist ar often unfamiliar with the latest paradigm

and technolog advanc in graphic comput.

 

thi interdisciplinari cours is intend to bridg the gap

between comput scienc and chemistri and to equip chemistri

research who wish to be more than just casual user of

prepackag graphic softwar. although thi is not intend to

be a cours in comput chemistri or drug design, data set

from chemic research problem will be us in lab and student

will be encourag to bring data set of their own. lab exercis

and project will be carri out us data-flow program

(ibm visual data explor softwar) and student will have

access to cornel theori center comput resourc, includ video

record equip.

 

audienc:  research and student in the chemic and biolog

           scienc interest in integr state-of-the-art

           comput graphic into their research; comput scientist

           wish to gain familiar with a major applic of

           scientif visual.

 

           the class size will be limit to 25 particip on a

           first-come first-serv basi.

 

level:     graduat/advanc undergradu, 1 or 2 credit. mai be taken

           without credit as a workshop. calculu, linear algebra

           and introductori chemistri requir. familiar with unix,

           x-window and c is us but not requir.

format

 

the cours will be held in the theori center train facil

where comput workstat will be avail.  daili lectur will be

interspers with laboratori exercis and ampl time will be provid

for project enabl and familiar with the new comput

environ. student enrol for on credit will be grade on the basi

of their laboratori exercis and short final project. those enrol

for a second credit will receiv more advanc lectur, be given

more time for project develop and meet daili to share experi

and discuss problem encount.
