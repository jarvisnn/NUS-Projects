| how do you do bu-master on the isa bu?



as an earlier post note - through dma.

| if we're talk isa (at) bu here, then you can onli have 1 dma channel

| activ at ani on time, presum transfer data from a singl devic.

| so even though you can have at least 7 devic on a scsi bu, explain how

| all 7 of those devic can to dma transfer through a singl scsi card

| to the isa-at bu at the same time.



ani on time mean imho a singl byte xfer. if i have four sourc of

dma request readi, the dma would servic the on after the other. if

the bandwidth for the four togeth is lower than the isa/dma

bandwidth, thi will work.



note that the bu master here is the prioriti mechan in the dma

control.
