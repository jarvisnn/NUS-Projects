ye, i have both art & letter and coreldraw.  i person like

art & letter better but there ar thing i like about art & letter

that coreldraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  i haven't found the perfect

graphic program that doe everyth yet.  



my favorit featur from coreldraw is that it import alot of differ

format.  art & letter doe not.  i like the thousand of clipart

avail with art & letter.  howev, i do find look them up

in a book and referenc them by number to be annoi.



on of my major problem is that there isn't ani program avail on

the market for the artist depriv :-).
