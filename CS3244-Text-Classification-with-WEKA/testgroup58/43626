hei all-



we have an old (1990) extern hd attach to the plu in our lab.  it had  

given us flawless servic until last week.  the problem: someon in our lab  

ha an old 512 that wa upgrad a coupl year ago to a plu with an  

aftermarket simm/scsi setup (digigraph "simmer").  the db25 scsi plug run  

through the back of the machin and attach to the board with a 26-pin  

rectangular connector.  well, thi gui had remov the back from the machin,  

to put more memori in, and had disconnect the the scsi plug.  sinc the  

26-pin connector is symmetr (not kei) he mai have reinstal it upsid  

down, essenti revers the pin on the db25.  he came in and ask if he  

could try out our hd on hi scsi port (it had never been us).  naiv fool  

that we ar, we said o.k..  hi comput fail to recogn the drive.  now,  

none of the comput in our lab will recogn it.  we tri disk doctor, and  

it doesn't recogn anyth on the scsi chain.  could instal the scsi  

upsid down have wreck the hd's driver board?  the drive seem to spin up  

all right and unpark itself upon powerup.  the event ar too coincident to  

attribut the problem to stiction.



ani help greatli appreci-
