i have the 1 meg card with the crystal scan 15 inch also.  i see veri

faint shadow on the left side of the screen onli in 1024 x 768 mode,

but not enough to realli bother me.  the charact on the screen

ar clear until i turn on the crystal font, then thei becom blurri.



i have a friend who ha 2 meg on the video card who ha the same shadow,

but sai the crystal font ar, well, crystal clear.



we ar both us build 59 of the mach32 driver. neither of us ha a monitor

extens cabl.  i tri the build55 driver and found no differ.
