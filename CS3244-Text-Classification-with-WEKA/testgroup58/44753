i am have the problem of ensur point-to-focu when the mous

cursor enter a window in my applic.  i'm us interview,

but that mai not matter, thi seem to be a gener problem in x.

for exampl, i us openwindow on a sparc2, with point-to-focu

set, and that gener work, but not alwai, depend on what

wa go on in some window when i move the cursor from on shell

tool window to anoth.  or so it seem...

focu within my applic?  thank for ani respons.
