   i am desper try to find a pc base e-mail wide area network servic

or the necessari network softwar to establish on myself. while i am awar

there ar variou bb's and other similar servic aval (like compuserv,

canada remot system etc.) i requir fairli specif criteria. in 

approxim order of import thei ar:



1) the mail/file/new ar read/written local and batch to the network

   server. (ie. no continu on-line connect)(note: all user ar remot

   and will us modem over convent phone line.)



2) simpl. the user i have for the system have veri littl comput knowledg

   have never heard of unix, and have veri littl interest in learn. it is

   essenti that the client softwar is complet pain-free.



3) cheap. we would prefer not pai high connect fee to an establish

   commerci network, just so we can send larg file between member of the

   group - henc (1). in addit i would like the network server to be

   someth small, simpl and inexpens like a 486. (there ar onli about

   40 peopl in the group, so it is not a huge network.)



4) the capabl for internet access (for new/mail).



5) internet style id's (eg. pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca)





   if anyon know of a system similar to what i am describ, even if it

doesn't sastisfi all my criteria, and i don't care where it is, pleas pleas

e-mail me and tell me about it. we ar not advers to make alter to

an exist system if necessari.



thank.
