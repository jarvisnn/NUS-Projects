paintshop pro for window is a fantast product.  it can handl tiff, gif,

bmp, pcx, and mani other format, displai them and convert between

them.  there is a sharewar version of the program; i assum it's avail

in the window area of the standard anonym ftp locat (i'd try

ftp.cica.indiana.edu).  log in as ftp, us your usernam as a password,

and look for a program call psp101.ex or someth like that.  i have

the regist version, and the onli major differ i can detect is that

the unregist version pop up a messag when you start the program

ask you to pleas regist it.



onc again, fantast softwar.  up to 24 bit, huge imag, everyth.
