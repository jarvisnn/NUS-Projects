    overview



    the dib imag file format is intend to be a "devic independ  bitmap"

    file  format.  (what microsoft mean by "devic independ" is unclear to

    me.) four pixel resolut ar support: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit

    pixel.



    these imag were intend for us on do (ibm, or littl-endian) system.

    if	you  ar  creat them on anoth architectur you will have to byte-

    swap all short and long integ valu.



    by convent, dib imag end in the extens ".bmp".   thi  is  becaus

    thei  ar  a  super-set of earlier "bitmap imag file".  consequ you

    will sometim hear dib file refer to as "bmp" file.



    sinc dib imag file ar a super-set, there ar three "flavor"  of  dib

    imag:

	 o   do dib imag.  these ar the recommend	 convent,  and  the

	     form  which i will describ how to creat.	 thei ar intend for

	     applic run under ms window /3.0 in a do environ.

	 o   os/2 dib imag.  my understand is that these ar  the	flavor

	     of dib imag that were us by the present manag.

	 o   old-style bitmap imag.

    differ between flavor



    the do dib imag consist of:

	 1.  a "bitmapfilehead" file header which identifi the file	 as  a

	     dib  file.	  thi	header	also give the total size of the imag

	     file, and the offset to the imag data.

	 2.  a "bitmapinfohead"  imag  header  which	 specifi  the	 imag

	     attribut.

	 3.  an option palett of color us by the imag.  if  it  exist,

	     thi  mai contain 2, 16, or 256 entri.  each entri is a window

	     rgbquad structur.

	 4.  the imag data itself.





    the os/2 dib imag consist of:

	 1.  the same "bitmapfilehead" file header which identifi the file

	     as	 a  dib	 file.	 thi  header also give the total size of the

	     imag file, and the offset to the imag data.

	 2.  a "bitmapcorehead"  imag  header  which	 specifi  the	 imag

	     attribut.

	 3.  an option palett of color us by the imag.  again, if  thi

	     exist  it	 mai  contain  2, 16, or 256 entri.  each entri is a

	     window rgbtripl structur.

	 4.  the imag data itself.





    the old style imag bitmap consist of:

	 1.  either a bitmapinfohead or a  bitmapcorehead.	 which	header

	     type is determin by the first long integ (dword) valu.

	 2.  an option color palett.	  thi	palett	 mai  be  compos  of

	     either   window	rgbquad	  structur  (if  the	header	wa  a

	     bitmapinfohead) or window rgbtripl structur (if the	header

	     wa a bitmapcorehead).

	 3.  the imag data itself.





    creat dib imag file.



    creat a do dib imag file consist of sever straight forward	step.

    the header need to be creat and then written to the file.  these header

    structur ar defin in the ms  window/3.0  "window.h"	includ	 file.

    palett  inform  need	 to  be	 store for imag that ar not 24-bit

    imag.  the five gener step ar:

	 1.  fill  in  the  bitmapfilehead	  and	the   bitmapinfohead

	     structur the basic imag inform.

	 2.  if the imag is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit imag,	 creat  the

	     color palett of rgbquad.

	 3.  calcul the total file size and put thi  inform  in

	     the "bfsize" field of the bitmapfilehead.

	 4.  calcul the offset to the imag data from the	start  of  the

	     file,   and   put  thi  in  the  "bfoffbit"	field  of  the

	     bitmapfilehead.

	 5.  write to the file the bitmapfilehead,	the  bitmapinfohead,

	     the color palett, and the imag data (in that order).



    the follow section describ structur in term of microsoft  c	 type-

    the bitmapfilehead



    thi structur is defin in "window.h" as:

	 typedef struct tagbitmapfilehead {

		 word	 bftype;

		 dword	 bfsize;

		 word	 bfreserv1;

		 word	 bfreserv2;

		 dword	 bfoffbit;

	 } bitmapfilehead;



    the "bftype" field is the two ascii charact 'b' and 'm'.	  thi	serv

    to	identifi  the  file  as	 a  dib	 imag file.  on an intel byte order

    machin (ibm or a compat), thi constant can be form	in  c  as  the

    quantiti ('m' << 8 | 'b') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.



    the "bfsize" field is the total size of the file.  for our	purpos  thi

    field  is equal to: the size of the bitmapfilehead, plu the size of the

    bitmapinfohead, plu the number of entri in the	 color	palett	 time

    the	 size  of  a  rgbquad, plu the number of byte of imag data.	if the

    imag data is be written out in an uncompress form, thi valu can be

    calcul	ahead  of  time.   otherwis, thi field need to be fill in

    later.



    both the "bfreserv1" and the "bfreserv2"  field  ar  alwai  set  to

    zero.



    the "bfoffbit" field is set to the offset to the start of the imag  data

    from  the  start  of the file.  for our purpos, thi field should be set

    to:	 the  size  of	the   bitmapfilehead,	  plu	 the   size   of   the

    bitmapinfohead,  plu  the  number of entri in the color palett time

    the size of a rgbquad.  thi work out becaus the imag data  is  written

    write after the color palett if on exist.

    the bitmapinfohead



    thi structur is defin in "window.h" as:

	 typedef struct tagbitmapinfohead{

		 dword	 bisiz;

		 dword	 biwidth;

		 dword	 biheight;

		 word	 biplan;

		 word	 bibitcount;

		 dword	 bicompress;

		 dword	 bisizeimag;

		 dword	 bixpelspermet;

		 dword	 biypelspermet;

		 dword	 biclrus;

		 dword	 biclrimport;

	 } bitmapinfohead;



    the "bisiz" field is set to the size of  the  bitmapinfohead  structur

    itself.   when  read  the  imag	 file,	thi  valu is what is us to

    determin  that  the  imag	 contain  a  bitmapinfohead	 and   not   a

    bitmapcorehead.



    the "biwidth" field is the width of the imag in imag pixel.



    the "biheight" field is the height of the imag in imag line.



    the "biplan" field should alwai be set to 1.  thi data is written  out

    as if there wa on color plane.



    the "bibitcount" field is the bit-depth of the imag.  thi must be either

    1, 4, 8, or 24, depend on the bit-depth of the imag data.



    the "bicompress" field tell how the imag data is compress if it  is

    compress.	   dib	imag	support	 two  form  of	 run-length  encod.

    howev, i have never seen ani imag which us it, and don't know yet how

    it work.  set thi field to zero (long zero, or 0l), to indic that the

    data is not compress.



    all subsequ field of the bitmapinfohead  structur  mai  be  set  to

    zero.   a  requir  of	the  interpret softwar that it be abl to

    comput these field as necessari from the previou inform.



    the field which you might want to explicitli specifi might be "biclrus".

    for	 4-bit	and  8-bit  imag  thi  field	 indic that not all of the

    possibl color entri ar us and that the  imag	 contain  "biclrus"

    color.  if you ar us onli 32 color with an 8-bit imag, then you mai

    onli want to save 32 of the possibl 256 palett entri.  gener,  set

    thi field to zero.

    color palett



    each entri of a  color  palett  is	 a  rgbquad  structur.	  the  rgbquad

    structur is defin in the "window.h" includ file as:

	 typedef struct tagrgbquad {

		 byte	 rgbblue;

		 byte	 rgbgreen;

		 byte	 rgbred;

		 byte	 rgbreserv;

	 } rgbquad;

    the "rgbreserv" field is alwai zero.  for each color us,  the	amount

    of blue, green, and red ar fill into the structur and the structur is

    written to the file.  a valu of zero in  the  "rgbblue",  "rgbgreen",  or

    "rgbred"   field  indic  that	that  particular  compon  doe  not

    contribut to the color composit.  a valu  of  255  in	ani  of	 these

    field  indic  that  the  compon  contribut  fulli	 to  the color

    composit.







    imag data



    there ar three surpris about the order of imag data	in  dib	 imag

    file.   the	 creator  of  thi  format  wa determin to be creativ, and

    certainli wa.



    within the imag data, each line written out is pad to  the  next  four

    byte  quantiti.   so,  if  you had an 8-bit imag which wa onli on pixel

    wide, you still have to write out four byte for everi  imag  line.   the

    number of byte per line can be calcul as:



		 byte_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;



	---or, in term of the field of the bitmapinfohead structur---



		 byte_per_line = (biwidth * bibitcount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;





    when write out your imag data, you must write it out bottom line first.

    the	 bottom line of the imag as you would look at it on the screen is the

    first line of imag data in the file.



    for 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit imag, inform is written	as  you	 would

    expect.   on  bit	imag	ar  pad  eight pixel to a byte.  four bit

    imag ar pad two pixel to a byte.  eight bit imag ar written  on

    pixel per byte.  twenti-four bit imag ar written three byte per pixel.

    howev, for 24-bit imag the inform must  be	 written  out  in  the

    order  blue,  green, red.  while most imag file format write data out in

    order.

    thi  should  provid  enough  inform	to  creat  dib	 imag	  from

    applic  such	as  scanner  or for imag export routin.	if you

    find out ani more about dib imag, pleas pass the inform on	to  me
