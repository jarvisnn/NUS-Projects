[ ..see previou articl on thi debat for the rest.. ]



i can see xv-3.00 agre with my view in case you don't -- even i sai

my person opinion (as abov), it doesn't mean that it is not most

obviou thing.

pleas, if you us my previou write as contradict argument,

pleas do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just

refer to text from which i wrote 'someth' -- and you make

hard decis from that, without read what exactli i have written.



it is realli hard read when on write a repli line by line method

and don't understand includ previous written materi with the new

sentenc to give them mean. you seem to be on such.



you also start repli to my articl, even you don't understand what

is go on; you ask me repeatedli to decsrib my view what were

wrong with xv 2.21 even i post them within the articl you did repli

to. believ me, it is not nice to get flame special when i know

that you have not read my articl carefulli in the first place.



xv-3.00 and jpeg faq and user i have written to agre me with the

place you didn't; i'm sure you just didn't undertand what about i

wrote. we can blame my write skill (in english?) for that, or?



better stop the discuss and check what new idea xv-3.00 give;

i allreadi mail on to bradlei...
