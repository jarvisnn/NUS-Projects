well 48 bit colour *could* be for improv resolut but 16 bit per channel

seem like a bit excess. i have seen a paper that quot 10 bit per channel

of 12 bit for comput precis. more than that would seem to be wast.



perhap the frame buffer us anoth colourspac which need more bit to

repres the full rang - rgb is a cube so it is a compact encod.



most like howev is that there ar two separ 24 bit (8 bit per compon)

frame buffer. thi set up, call doubl buffer, allow a complex 3d pictur

to be built up on on buffer while the other buffer (contain the previou

frame) is displai. thi make for smoother anim.



>(sadli, i have access to none of them.  just a dec 5000/25.  sigh.)



well hei if you want to brag about number, the 5000 rang can take a pxg turbo+

card with 96 bit per pixel. full doubl buffer (two 24 bit buffer), a 24

bit z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen imag storag.



mind you the card cost more than your workstat.
