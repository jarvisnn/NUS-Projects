what version of winfax do you have?  the newest version (3.0) ha an ocr

(optic charact recognit) built in... what thi mean is that it can

take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ascii so that on can edit

the document w/o re-type it... howev, i found that the ocr that come

packag with winfax doe not work as well as omnipag profession (also

by delrina softwar)... so, onc again, winfax ver. 3.0 ha what you ar

look for... good luck!
