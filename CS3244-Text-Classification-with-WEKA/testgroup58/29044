hi!



we have an old montag fr-1 35mm film record. when connect to a pc with

it processor card it can directli take hpgl, targa and lasergraph languag

file. 24 bit targa is quit ok for raster imag, but convers from 

whatev on happen to have can be quit slow. thi lasergraph languag

seem to be (got the sourc file for on test imag) a vector-base languag

that can handl on million color. it doe some polygon too, and perhap

someth els ?



the question is, where can i find some inform about thi languag ?

a ftp site, a book, a compani address,.... ?



(ok, it would be nice to have a window driver for it, but i'm not that

optimist...)



thank in advanc for ani help!
