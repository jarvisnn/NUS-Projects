i am not sure that i am suppos to post thi mail here. howev

dure the last year, while i wa involv in develop graphic user

interfac (gui) applic, i have enjoi be person part of thi

new group wherin i got some interest inform which help me in my

work. i am post my resum hope that peopl work in my area would

make time to look at it.

dear prospect employ:



i am seek employ as a softwar engin with interest in softwar

design and develop, in which i can util my experi in hardwar, 

c & c++ program, graphic user interfac (gui), oper system and

comput network.



i receiv my bachelor of engin (be) degre in electron

engin in 1990 and a m.s. degre in electr engin in dec 1992 

from iowa state univers. current i am enrol in a m.s. in comput

engin at iowa state univers.



dure my master program, as a research assist sinc jan 1991, i have

publish three paper includ on in the ieee transact on magnet.

these paper ar a reflect of the qualiti of my research and my abil

to learn new concept quickli.



i have been involv in mani project involv softwar develop and

have extens experi program in c, c++, fortran and assembl level. 

i am also familiar with oper system like unix, ultrix and ms-do.

i am familiar with motif/x program and current, as a research assist,

am involv in graphic user interfac (gui) design us the multiplatform 

gui toolkit xvt++. my experi also includ area such as oper system

and comput network, through cours work and project. i wa involv in the

studi of the design and develop of the intern of the xinu oper

system. i have also been involv in mani tcp/ip program project in

comput network.



while in colleg i learnt the import of clear and concis commun.

i have also learn a lot about time manag. in my m.s. program i

have maintain a 3.70 grade averag, work 20 hour per week and

have enjoi be involv in mani other extra curricular activ.



my softwar experi along with my hardwar background (electron

engin) would be veri help in my career goal as a softwar engin.

i request that my qualif mai kindli be review. i would like to

have an interview to discuss your employ need and my career goal. 

i am eager to hear from you soon.





sincer
