we ar plan on bui 15-20 x termin.  i have the articl from jim

morton regard price, etc., and am look for ani other inform

that will help me decid which to bui.



the termin will be connect to a dec 3000/400 axp with 96mb ram,

run osf/1.  from what i have found out so far, it would be best to run

as much as possibl in the termin itself (x11, window manag, xterm,

etc.), and that in order to do thi we need n mb ram in the xtermin

(where n rang from 4 to 10, depend on who i talk to).



what should i be look for?  what sort of question should i be ask

the salespeopl?



thank
