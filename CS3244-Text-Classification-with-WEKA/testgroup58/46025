seen from a typograph point of view, atm us postscript font

is better than truetyp; the hint mechan incorpor in ps is

gorgeou.

multilingu user mai see the limit of possibl differ charact in

a ps font as problemat; thei mai have better us of the unicod

featur of tt font (in window nt).



i've seen *lot* of realli beauti and printabl-in-small-size ps font;

i haven't seen those as tt font. most of them ar render quit

inaccur (in small size, esp. as screen font).

simpli compar timesnewroman as a ps font with the tt font; the first

look better.



i am hope that there will be atm/nt !
