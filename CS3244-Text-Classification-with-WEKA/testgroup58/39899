is there a hot-kei for the window 3.1 screen saver util?  if not, is

there an easi wai to creat on?  the reason that i need on is that my

dad's compani is anal retent about leav a comput while the

inform can be access so the employe ar not allow to walk awai

from the comput until the screen saver kick in (as if that is terribl

secur).  also, the system manag won't let ani softwar be ad so 

anoth program such as lock32.zip from cica or a differ screen saver

is out.



thank for ani and all help.
