hello again,



about a week and on-half ago i post a queri look for peopl feel

on the inkjet famili of printer.  specif, a comparison between the

canon bj200 (bubblejet) and the hewlett-packard deskjet 500.  mani peopl

ask me to post the summari/account of all the post and e-mail i

receiv.  below is my origin queri and the respons i receiv.  i have

not delet ani part of the respons, onli the header and signatur, so

you can extract what you find necessari.  some peopl ask me for an

unbias account; howev, the veri natur of the question suggest

favorit and bias comment, you must extract the inform you

believ unbias and a fair represent of each printer.  there ar a

wide rang of comment, each ha it own valu.  



there wa no clear winner, some like the bj200 (especi it

price/perform ratio), other prefer the durabl and reliabl

of the deskjet (the origin inkjet with proven driver and a solid

background).  two new inkjet printer have drawn some attent, a new

printer to be introduc by hewlett-packard later thi year (around

summertim), and an addit to the epson product line (their first

inkjet).  you will find that after the initi purchas, the cost of

re-fill or replac the ink cartridg ar about the same (thi larg

depend on where you purchas the re-fill or replac -- so shop

around first sinc thi aspect will most like domin the cost of your

printer).  no on mention approx. how mani sheet each ink cartridg will

print, but i suspect thei ar roughli equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheet

(laser printer will do 4000-5000 sheet per toner cartridg).  well,

that's a brief research summari of my person research.  enjoi!

well i bought the bj 200 about a month ago at the start of their $50 rebat

program on that printer (it end 5/31), and i bought it from comput

discount warehous becaus their price of $325 couldn't be beat anywher i

look, and i think it's a hot printer.  just us regular copier paper

produc fantast result just in high qualiti mode.  i compar the

output of a micrografx design legal size draw with 4pt type done on my

bj 200 with the same draw print on an hp laserjet iid and i wa amaz

how well i could read the small print on the bj 200.  print speed wa

sever second faster on the bj 200 which is amaz consid that the

hp ha 2.5m ram instal.  i measur the time from when the printer first

indic it wa receiv data (as i us print manag in window).



i show the output to sever peopl at work and on manag bought on

immedi for hi offic, and two other engin place their order

too.  if you need cdw's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  deliveri to ny

wa two dai.



good luck!

i own a deskjet 500. perform isn't spectacular under window us

truetyp font but neither is the canon from what i have seen. qualiti for

the hp is veri much depend on paper qualiti - on 'standard' photo-copi

paper the charact have slightli 'frai' edg but on better qualiti

'distinct' type paper thing look better. for most applic i find

copi paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  come with a window

driver, which seem to by-pass print manag, ha a few

'intelli-font'which ar hp scaleabl font - probabl faster than truetyp

but haven't realli tri them out. can get ram & font cartridg but unless

the speed of truetyp is a problem i wouldn't bother. the ram cartridg

can't be us as buffer - soft font onli.



for graphic, i.e. bmp imag etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via

the hp suppli win driver. there a number of dither option such as

'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  the manual give recommend depend on

the type of imag be print.  text is not so good in thi mode. problem

aris when you have a document which contain both graphic and text.  the

rang of tone for graphic imag isn't brilliant but i think that is more

of a limit with inkjet printer in gener.



>from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respect.



howev, a printer definit worth look at is the new inkjet from

epson.  thi printer is faster, cheaper, and capabl of produc

laser-like qualiti on normal copier paper.  can't rememb the model #, lx

- someth i think?



i purchas my hp dai befor the epson wa releas here :-{.  the

introductori price on the epson wa the same as the hp here in new zealand.

 

===========================================================================



about a month ago, i got a canon bj200.  i absolut love it.  it is

incred fast, except for print from pspice (i don't know if you ever

do stuff with that or not.)  most of the stuff i print is either from

microsoft word for window or just plain text.  the onli problem i've had

ar print header/footer (the printer freak out), and print on

cheap paper (lot of streak).  normal copi paper work great with it, you

can onli tell it's not laser-print by hold it, oh, less than twelv

inch from your face.  (that is, if you're nearsight, like me! :) ) the

printer come with it own driver for window 3.1!!  i have no other

complaint.  the printer also can act just like some epson or anoth for

those archaic softwar packag that haven't written a driver for it yet.

the teeni-weeni footprint is a real plu, too--and, if you purchas it

between now and mai 31, you get a $50 rebat from canon!!  i bought mine

from a store call compusa, and the price now is $340.  i have a friend

who ha the hp you ar look at.  it also print veri well, and everyon

ha driver for it, but it is veri slow!



hope i help!



(360dpi sure look great!)

  i guess i have some experi with both: i have a bj-300 at work and a

deskjet 500 at home.  i prefer the deskjet.  the print speed and qualiti

ar similar (i test both with text and graphic befor bui the deskjet

for home).  the featur that set the deskjet apart is the driver support

in so mani applic.  the bj end up emul the epson lq or ibm

proprint to get it to work with mani non-window app and thi will be

the case for a long time.  the design is superior if you just want to us

cut paper, the deskjet is quieter, and the ink cartridg ar quit a bit

cheaper due to the number of deskjet out there in comparis to the bj.



  just my $0.02 worth..

  ye, there is the landscap mode print problem, but it doe not

present a problem in window as the window printer driver handl the

translat.  i actual thought of some other point after i post the

note.  the deskjet ha an unprint area of approxim .5inch around

the paper the bubblejet doe not.  you ar right about the graphic

resolut, i test the printer with the applic i had access to:

wordperfect, harvard graphic, wingif, paintshop pro, and paintbrush and

could not tell a differ.  in fact on of the hp deskjet window driver

give you signific control over the contrast and densiti of the printer

henc control the amount of ink you put down.  the bubblejet did not.

i had no imag softwar to test the printer with and so had no

comparis there.  final, i want sheet feed.  in that configur

the bubblejet cost approxim $100 more than the deskjet.



i went through a pretti thorough evalu and chose the deskjet when i

spent my own monei.  btw, i am replac the bj-300 with a deskjet 500 at

work thi month anywai.

i spent some time compar the two.  we end up get the bubblejet

bj-200 versu the hp.  our reason were:



1) the hp seem to have wors band than the canon

2) 360dpi versu 300 - we felt we could see the differ

3) price - canon ha a $50 rebat program go on at the moment.



the bj-200 wa our choic over the bj-10ex - we could have 100 page in the

bj-200 feeder.  the bj-10ex hold onli 30 page, i think.



as you can see, up to 100 page on the bj-200.  we haven't done anyth

big with the bj, but it perform seem reason under window.  i

know that the microsoft bb ha a newer window driver than come with the

printer, but i don't know how it compar (also the driver includ with

the printer is canon's wherea i don't know where the microsoft bb on

come from - microsoft?)



hope thi help.

altough i'm sometim also a salesperson (if i'm not suppost to studi :-))

i would recommend to bui the bj200. the print qualiti is a bit better,

but you you've got much more possibl. don't forget the hp engin is at

least 2 year on the mark, the canon engin (witch is also us in

other "new" bubblejet printer like e.g. the epson on) is quit recent

avail..

i've seen dure a short demonstr (from someon who try to sell me

canon printer) 2 time the same pictur, on print with the bj200, on

with the canon, the other with the hp, and.. there wa a differ in

print- qualiti,.. the canon wa a bit better..

when we decid we need quiet printer in our hospit we look to

inkjet printer.  thei have near laser qualiti, speed, and thei ar quiet.

we us both hp deskjet and the canon bj-200s.  i prefer the paper handl

qualiti of the deskjet but i feel the canon have superior print

qualiti.  the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder, howev i did end

up bui a deskjet for home us (got too good a deal).  anywai, we ar

us canon in high volum area and thei ar hold up veri well.  out

of 15 deskjet and 4 bj-200s i have onli had on problem with a deskjet and

that wa taken care of veri quickli by hp.

===========================================================================



whenev i bui anyth i look at what the "expert" sai, pick out the top

few and then bui on whatev criteria ar the most apt.  i've been

unusu flush late (no beg letter pleas) and so i've done thi a

few time includ - about four month ago - with inkjet printer.



i can't rememb much about the process except that i read about three

review of inkjet and that the 500 wa alwai at or near the top.  i

bought the 500c becaus of the ad dimens of colour (i intend to build

a multi- media machin at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner

toward that).  although i haven's us the colour thing in earnest yet i

tri it out on a coupl of window bitmap and i wa pleas with the

result.



i note that even though you can now get the 550c (the on with both colour

and mono with no need to chang the cartridg), the 500c and 500 ar still

readili avail (at least in the uk).  the follow ar my

view/experi:



	1.	i don't know anyth about the canon except that i came awai

		from review (and repli to a post similar to your) with

		the idea that the hp offer the best perform/price ratio.



	2.	i believ hp ar the origin in the field - not alwai the

		ideal place to be but the market's still young so on assum

		thei have the expertis.



	3.	the 500c is worth the extra.  oper in mono is perfectli

		accept and i get good crisp reproduct of font from

		window.



	4.	i us to work for monotyp when thei still manufactur

		typesett (befor their american owner close them down!)

		and i can tell you that in term of definit 300 dpi is

		pretti poor anywai so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...



	5.	the hp come with a reason set of driver.



	6.	if you bui it invest in the addit ram pack - it's pretti

		slow with it, god know what it's like without!



i actual work in germani and my pc is home in the uk so it's not in daili

us.  i would sai that apart from my not read the manual properli and

have a realli dumb problem at the start it's easi peasi to oper.



hope thi is of us.

just bought the bj-200.  i thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with

$50 rebat thru 5/31) and so far it is compar, even superior, to the

deskjet in print qualiti.



speed:   per page rate seem to be faster (i don't have figur).

         i don't print long doc, though.



qualiti: i think the graphic qualiti is excel.  print qualiti is

         excel as well, unless you us small font and hold it up

         close; you can see a lot more "jaggi" than on a laserjet.

         the 360 dpi is offset by a littl less accuraci in hold the

         page/print head in place, i would imagin.



larg doc:  not room in the standard model for a whole lotta page ...

         manual sai up to 100, though.  haven't tri it.



driver:  no problem under win3.1 yet.  winword doesn't want to print

         the envelop the same wai the canon doe, though.



know noth of add-on cost.

i just bought a bj-200 printer a coupl of dai ago.  i compar it to the

sampl print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp wasn't for me.  the

bj-200 is pretti fast and realli print with good qualiti.  i can compar

it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and thei look almost ident (

depend on the kind of paper).  i don't have problem with the ink not

be dry, it seem to dry veri fast.  probabl within a second.  sinc

canon is give a $50 rebat until the end of mai, it is realli a good bui.

wow, it's funni you should ask thi.  i'm a littl behind in new read

so i know thi mai be late.



  i just purchas the canon bubblejet last night.  i wa realli worri

that i wouldn't like it but the print qualiti, and nois level is

fantast!  i print quit a few document with lot of graphic and it

print damn near laser qualiti.  you can't tell it's not laser unless you

get 2 inch from the page.



  no problem with driver.  the printer came with the driver diskett

which is good becaus i wa begin to panic when i couldn't findi it

under window or wordperfect.  it work well under both.  i have yet to

instal word for window so don't know how it work with them.



  i had a deskjet 500 at work last year.  it wa a good printer as well ut

i felt it wa awfulli slow.  and much noisier than the bubblejet.  i won't

sai the bubblejet is much better, but i realli do like it more.  just my

$0.02 worth.
