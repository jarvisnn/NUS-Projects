i've had similar problem w/ other board type, and the problem is not a

result of the 8/24gc board! try zap the pram by hold down

"command-option-p-r" dur startup! you will have to reset everyth to

your previou prefer (the date & time remain intact!), but the video

board will start rememb it's previou set!
