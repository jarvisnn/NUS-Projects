i guess the real question is:



who ask the origin question, and why wa it so _broad_.

ar we talk pure process power (what kind of process btw)

isol from everi other factor and influenc in the system?  

or ar we shop for a home comput base on the cpu spec (yuck)!



i just finish a project that involv real-time process of serial

data and discov that the program interfac (assembl) ha

_a lot_ to do with the "power" of a cpu in a particular applic.

if what you want to do is easi to code with the instruct set given,

then not onli is it easi, but it's cheap and quick.  if you have to

fake thing (like resolv indirect without a lea instruct), then

your cycl count goe through the roof!



well, let's _not_ start a flame war about whose comput is better than whose.

the orgin question wa about classifi micro-processor...

have re-read the entir thread, i don't think much more can be said without

get down into specif propos system with import detail given.





that's it for anoth $0.02.



cheer everyon.
