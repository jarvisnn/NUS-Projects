     you  should  try  have  a  .xsession  script in $home to do these

thing.  xdm will  start  up  your  process  us  the  system  version

(usual /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xsession), which should check whether you have

your won and chang to that if you do.  (take a copi of the  system  on

and edit it). 



     note, that thi file requir "x" access to be set.
