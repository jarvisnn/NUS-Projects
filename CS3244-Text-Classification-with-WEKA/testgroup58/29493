hello,



	i am admin for an rs/6000 run aix 3.2, x11r5, motif, and xdt3.

	i want to prevent the user from hit cntl-alt-bkspc to exit x.

	

	i've tri invok x with 'xinit -t', but that doesn't work.

	xinit append the -t to the call to .xinitrc, and not to the

	call to x.  



	the man page to xinit is no help.  in fact, it tell

	me that xinit is a script when it is realli a binari file.  



	so far, the onli wai i've been abl to accomplish thi feat is

	to add the -t to the call to x in /usr/lpp/x11/default/xserverrc.

	i would rather not do it thi wai.  doe anyon have ani other idea?
