the fan in my power suppli, like most, is distractingli loud. ha anyon found 

a solut to run a pc with peac and quiet? short of bui a notebook 

pc, i don't know what to do. oh yeah, i did hear about a power suppli call a 

"silenc" - which is suppos to be more quiet. ha anyon had experi with

thi? i wa quot a price of $225 (!) for a 270watt silenc.



i've even consid stuf my pc case in on of those acoust "printer 

enclosur", but that wouldn't be the most eleg solut. also, i'm 

guess that would also cut the ventil.



ani other idea?



thank in advanc for ani suggest! pleas e-mail whatev you post...
