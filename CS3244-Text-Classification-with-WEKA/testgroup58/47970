put me down for a pb100 4/20 with ext. floppi, appletalk remot acc,

ac adapt, and fresh out of box (wa us, but buyer switch to 140

on arriv and sold unopen box. purchas last octob for $925.

later i bought a us powerport v.32 9600 bp intern fax-modem for

someth like $225, i'm us right now! work great!  :)



no real complaint. i love my portabl system (got a color home setup

also. mac ii). reason wa that matlab program at school and other

simul of dynam control system sometim took hour (or

overnight) to run, ty up my mac ii. i got the pb100 with fast modem

to do light work and on-the-run stuff. i figur i'd give it to my

littl sister next year when she goe to colleg. it's run system

7.1 now without ani problem. also i sometim do dec4015 termin

emul with matlab on our univers's vax_vm (nice thing that it

benchmark itself as an averag of 230 time faster than a mac iifx).

so, the pb100 just doe graphic output and termin emul (not

too hard at all for it). it wa a fabul setup !!!!  :)  weeee!!!



(by the wai, all matlab softwar wa on class account. i wa also the

ta for a class that us simulab/simulink. we had site-licens and

take-home, then-destroi later site-releas licens... no pirat

there, incas you're wonder.... great program!!! )



just like to add, whatev futur system you get, you can almost never

get enuff memori.... bui it while it's cheap - that is bui it when you

get the comput sinc it's usual cheaper than upgrad... i alwai

run out of disk space... but i have a syquest on the mac iisi, so i

never worri about space befor... got sever cart).
