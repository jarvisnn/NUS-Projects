bandwidth is unlik to be the problem, except over a wet string network.

on of major flaw of x is the horrend number of transact (and

henc process switch) that it forc upon a host.  actual measur

(hourli averag) ar 5 per second per log in user, which can lead to

20-50 or more process switch (depend on whether each event is

filter by the window manag as well as the applic and how

mani process ar need for each charact.)



while a blink cursor need onli the applic and the network

process, and doe not add ani transact, it will add someth like

10 process switch per second per user.  thi is a signific increas

in overhead, especi as the applic mai have quit a larg work

set.  if you want a rapidli blink cursor, there could be as mani

as 50.



if you want to go there, i wouldn't start from here!
