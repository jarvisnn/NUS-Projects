diamond video card (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) 

mai have excel specif, and the window driver that

come with them might make window blindingli fast, but:



if you're consid bui a system, with a view to us

it to run unix (linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special softwar,

there is a good chanc that it will not work with the diamond card.

thi is due to diamond's proprieti attitud to it's hardwar:

it's imposs to get free inform from them about their chip 

(specif their dot-clock) without pai, and sign non-disclosur

agreement.



thi made it imposs for the free softwar foundat to provid

x-window compat with these card, as diamond didn't want to 

divulg program neccess.



as far as i know onli diamond ha thi proprieti on it's info.





mark.
