the courier is their top-of-the-line product, thu the higher price.  i've

never taken a real look at the sportster line (onli courier), but from what

i've gather, it's basic more of an entri-level modem.  probabl

doesn't meet the same specif that the courier doe.  i'm not sure

if the sportster line is fulli dsp driven like the (more recent) courier

modem ar, so upgrad in the futur mai be an issu.



again, take all of the abov with a grain of salt...i've never evalu

the sportster, so i'm go by bit and piec that i've heard.  if you

want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modem and you'll find

peopl who have work with the sportster.



person, though, if i were go to look at the courier modem, i'd

bui the dual standard...then i'd get both hst and v.32bi.  in fact, thi

is exactli what i did.  :-)  i'm sit here look at my usr ds right

now.



and now, to correct a few veri incorrect statement....  folk, if you want

to get reliabl answer to modem and/or uart question, post them to

comp.dcom.modem.  if you post in other group, you never know what you'll

get in the wai of an answer (you mai veri well get a good answer...or you

mai get someth like the on below).  at least in cdm, if someon post

complet and utter bs, you'll see a flurri of folk correct them (to

avoid spread faulti info).



>the sportster at 14.4 ha v.42 error control and v.42 bi data compress.



just as it doe at lower speed, too.  there is absolut noth in

either ccitt recommend v.42 or v.42bi that sai that thei can onli

oper on modem that ar run v.32bi.  v.42bi, of cours, is

current onli *standard* for oper on top of v.42 (in it primari

mode of oper, lapm), but that's about as far as that goe.



and just in case there's some confus on thi, v.42/v.42bi ar also

support by the courier line (unless you have a realli ancient on).



>the differ

>with the courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and onli in the hst mode. 



take a second look at the origin question:



>in a previou articl, cs3sd3ae@macc.mcmaster.ca (holli       ks) sai:

>>what is the differ between the us robot courier v32bi extern

                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

see the v.32bi up there?  the question wa not about the courier hst

modem, or about the courier dual standard...it wa about the courier

v.32bi modem.  the modem in question doe not support hst, period.  it

therefor doe not support the 16.8 kb hst.



also, not all courier hst / courier dual standard modem support the 16.8 kb

version of hst.  my dual standard onli support hst at 14.4 kb.  there ar

even older model that onli run hst at 9.6 kb.



>thi is a proprietari mode of usr and it will onli connect to anoth of

>the same type unit to achiev thi speed.



hst is usr's proprietari modul scheme....  but we're not talk about

hst, we're talk about v.32bi.  v.32bi is most definit *not* a

proprietari modul scheme.



>the sportster will do

>asynchron transmiss as well as synchron.  the hst is on wai

>onli.



i do hope you didn't mean for these two sentenc to be relat in some

wai.....



first off, v.32 and v.32bi ar both synchron and asynchron.  thi is

part of the ccitt recommend (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a

featur uniqu to the sportster (i just look at the appropri chapter

in the courier ds manual).



second, hst is not ``on wai onli.''  more correctli put, it is an

asymmetr modul scheme, mean it doesn't work at the same speed

in both direct.  hst oper at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in on direct,

and ha a low-speed back-channel in the other direct.  the high-speed

channel goe in the direct of the higher data flow.  thi is fine if

you're log on to sai, a bb, and type on letter and get screen of

info back, transfer file (not us bimodem), etc....  there is, of cours,

a penalti for turnaround time when the high-speed channel need to revers

direct.



v.32 and v.32bi ar both symmetr, mean thei do transfer the full

data rate in both direct at the same time.



third, synchron vs asynchron ha absolut noth to do with

symmetr vs asymmetr...thei ar two complet differ topic.



>the hst's will be upgrad to the v.fast spec when it is avail.



again, more correctli put, *some* of the courier line will be upgrad

to whatev ``v.fast'' is call when it's complet.  if you have the larg

footprint courier modem (like i do), you're s.o.l.....  there wa an

upgrad plan a while back to upgrad to a small footprint varieti, which

could eventu be upgrad to support v.fast, but the cost of the two

upgrad togeth pretti much put it higher than just bui a new modem.



later.....
