	i'd sai that the massiv crash problem ar exceedingli rare.

	window _itself_ almost never crash, but it can be crash by

	an errant applic (my person favorit?  ani on of the corel

	3.0 program).  on the other hand, i have had os/2 crash randomli

	a number of time, mostli just run it's own applic.



	for instanc.  todai i discov a new on.  while i wa download

	with procomm plu for window (run seamless with the standard

	vga driver on a run-o' da mill vga card--640x480), i decid that

	i want to edit a copi of a quot that i want to add to my 

	.finger.  but sinc i've learn not to realli trust seamless, 

	i fire up a full screen wino/23.1 session.  whoop, the download

	finish while wino/2 wa load.  it had _just_ gotten

	the pointer up, so i hit alt-escap to get back t the desktop

	(i have a lot of font, so load take a good long while).

	

	blam.  screen trash, procomm hang up.  hm.  well, i can sorta

	see the mous, so i click on the minim wino/2 session 

	and got back my fullscreen window session (but the color were

	off--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blue and grei).

	so i close thi, and got back to the desktop (now fulli restor).



	pp+ wa still sit, window open, but it wa no longer 

	"connect" to the com port--so i exit it (the normal wai--

	it told me i wa still onlin and it would hang up, though it

	wa _alreadi_ hung up).  hm.  well, load anoth--no, bad idea. 

	shutdown and reboot.



	ok, refresh first.. now, shutdown.  ye, everyth is close...



	hm.  noth seem to be happen.  let's see.. ah, the 

	window list still come up.  ok, let's try shutdown again.



	no go.  huh.



	alright, wait 60 second to see if it's just run slow.



	hmm.  still seem to be run os/2.  try shutdown again.

	noth.  oh well.  reboot.  enjoi the checkdisk time.

  

	in thi case, a part of the os crash not onli itself, but

	os/2 entir (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s

	been compromis, i guess).  in everydai (specif _todai_)

	us.





> os/2 give each window app a vdm and thei can't touch each other or

>(gener) anyth thei aren't suppos to have.





	that's the idea, anywai.  in truth, when a program crash on 

	os/2, it will bring the system down with it.  the program that

	would just gpf under window do the same under os/2, but program

	that ar fine under do and window bring os/2 scream to a halt,

	task protect or no.  



	for instanc, i'm still wonder why print preview in a window

	wp 5.1 (do) lock up my system.  it work fine under do or even in

	a do box under window 3.1.  (admittedli, it doesn't crash if i run

	wp51 full screen, but the first time thi bug big me, it bit hard).

>choic.  if window doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind wait on each

>task,





	pleas explain.  the onli time i wait on anyth under window is

	when i'm copi or format a floppi, or when print (and even

	then, not long--i get 9 to 11 page dump to the printman per 

	minut, and can _still_ go do thing--slowli--while it's do 

	thi--i've download with pp+ @9600 while print).







> and not be abl to adress your memori better than do,





	not sure what you mean here.  os/2 see 16 meg, us 5 or six

	of these for it's own us (more if you want to count wino/2). 

	window see 16 meg, us 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the

	disk cach as i am for os/2) for itself.  if memori effici 

	were a big issu, pc geo would be the current king of the 

	intel desktop.  





> some of the

>kei reason for us os/2 ar gone.  i probabl  would still us it, but it

>would be more of an even fight.





	on the other hand.. i am final abl to sai with some confid

	that both os/2 and window have a bit of hardwar sensit to

	them.  for instanc, the machin i am sit at run both fine, 

	while the machin next to me constantli lock up under window. 

	(but ran os/2 without a hitch onc i got it through a 5-crash 

	instal).  on the whole, i'd sai os/2 is a whole lot more sensit

	than window, but there ar (i suppos) machin that window

	just doesn't like.
