gener, the second or third major releas usual take care of it.

my advic, base on plenti of person experi, is to never bui the

first version of anyth from microsoft.  thi includ major version

number upgrad from previou releas, such as microsoft c 6.00.

alwai wait at least for the "a" upgrad or slipstream upgrad if

you're go to bui it.
