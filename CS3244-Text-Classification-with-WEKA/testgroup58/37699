      i wa skim through a few gopher and bump into on at nih

   with a databas that includ imag in .gif format.  while i have

   not yet work out the kink of get the gopher client to call

   an x viewer, i figur that the major of the user here ar not

   in an x11 environ - instead us do and ms-kermit.



      with kermit support tek4010 emul for graphic displai,

   doe anyon know of a packag that would allow a tek to displai a

   .gif imag?  it would be of more us to the local popul to

   plug someth of thi sort in as the 'pictur' command instead of

   xview or xloadimag ...
