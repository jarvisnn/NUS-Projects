thi is a fundament aspect of novel's busi; thei wouldn't be

where thei ar if thei didn't live up to their "novel doe print"

slogan.  we run 6 printer of vari type off our novel network;

i'm sure there ar place with hundr.



rtfm on the captur command, printcon, pserver, and the section of

the window 3.1 manual which cover network print.  if you haven't bought

novel's product yet, rephras your question and look for inform about

how *well* variou competitor do print.
