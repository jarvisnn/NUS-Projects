no.  i recent bought an lc ii with a 14" monitor.  the monitor come with

the type of power cabl that plug into the switch outlet on the back of

most larger mac.  sinc the lc ii doesn't have on of these outlet, there

wa an extra standard power cabl includ with the comput for us with

the monitor.  but it wa in the comput box, not the monitor box.  it's

not as if the cabl ar particularli expens, though.  $10-$15 at the

most.
