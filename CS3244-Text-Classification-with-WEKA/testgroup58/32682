so is there ani problem put a drive format vertic on

it side horizont?



i got a drive a few year ago with the rubber feet on the side,

etc. and have us it like that sinc (obvious design for that

orient). howev, it doesn't fit under ani of the clever

place i can think of to place it, so i would realli like to lai it

flat and put it under a low shelf.



thi is probabl not a "newer" drive, and it is onli 70 meg, but

when i bought it, it wa a larg drive for an averag user

(compar to bui a 200 meg drive todai). so is my old, 70 meg

drive as fragil (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?



just curiou.....
