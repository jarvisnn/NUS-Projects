(some) modern (state space) control analysi and design method. the

notebook in cosi_pak follow a typic `control engin i' cours

taught at mani univers around the world for the junior/senior 

level undergradu. there is no fee to us cosi_pak but certain 

respons ar expect of the user (see copyright notic in the 

readm file includ below). for starter e-mail / fax / mail (post) 

the registr form includ in the readm file.



cosi_pak is avail via `anonym ftp' from

     cosi_pak is avail by anonym `ftp' from

is given at the end of thi file.



**********************************************************************



--> chang in version 0.9 (updat from v0.81 to v0.9)



	in thi version, we have revis cosi_pak to take advantag of 

the more robust signal process function avail in mathematica v2.1.  

sinc mathematica 2.1 provid a better  and  work 

laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function than 

mathematica v2.0 did, we adopt them. thi ha made cosi_pak 

smaller. thu brian evan' signal process packag that support 

the laplacetransform  and inverselaplacetransform function in the 

cosi_pak v0.81 ar no longer need directli by cosi_pak v0.9. for 

power user who  us signal process we still recommend the us of the veri  

fine  brian evan packag on signal process (avail at 

the anonym  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  ip # 130.207.226.24).  on  

the  downsid, the disadvantag of thi updat 

can be that mathematica 2.1 requir more runtim resourc than it 

previou version. 





***********************************************************************	

--> for mathematica 2.0 user

	

	we have includ the laplacetransform packag from mathematica 2.1 in  

the directori `for_2.0'. pleas move all file and directori under for_2.0 into  

the calculu directori under mathematica packag directori.

--> introduct

   

    thi is an unsupport releas of cosi_pak - a control system 

analysi packag for symbol control system analysi us 

mathematica 2.1. classic control system analysi and design method and some  

modern control system method have been implement in thi packag. 

    

    thi packag and the attend notebook were develop on a 

next (tm) comput (a unix base workstat). thei have been 

us as a supplementari teach aid along with  standard control 

engin text (ogata [1991], phillip and harbor [1991]) for 

undergradu cours in `control engin i' taught at the system 

engin depart of cwru. in addit to the next, thei have 

also been test successfulli on appl macintosh comput (tm), and, 

ibm pc's (tm) run ms window(tm). we would be veri much interest 

to hear from you if you or anybodi you know us thi softwar on 

platform not mention abov. ibm user howev will have to 

evalu the notebook first to visual the graphic.



    onc instal (see below for instruct), thi  collect  of  

mathematica  packag  can be load by ani user. bundl with the 

packag ar mani notebook ("cosi_note") which demonstr  

the function of these packag. the notebook follow a plan of 

mani fine, standard, undergradu control engin text book

--> compress file



        the file that contain  a  complet set of the cosi_pak v0.9

packag and notebook for mathematica ar:



 cosi_pak_09.tar.z     		compress tar file for unix system

	

 cosi_pak_09.sit.hqx     	compress sit file for macintosh 

 				system and encod by binhex 4.0 

				format (requir the   sharewar

				 stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). 

	

 cosi_pak_ibm_09.zip    	zip file for the ibm pc run ms-do

    

     onc expand the mathematica file can also be us on 

macintosh / ibm pc / unix system also.





--> instal of cosi_pak



 o in unix command line type the follow command:



      zcat cosi_pak_09.tar.z | tar xvf -



 o in macintosh open the .sit.hqx file us the sharewar

    stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.

  

 o in ibm command line type the follow command:



      pkunzip -o -d cosi_pak_ibm_09.zip



note: thi .zip file wa zip by zip util v2.0. you must us 

pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  ibm pc's mai limit the 

directori name charact to eight. in that event type "pkunzip -o -d 

cosi_pak.zip.  you can also unzip the cosi_pak_ibm_09.zip file on ani 

unix machin if you have unzip util on it.





     uncompress and untar "cosi_pak_09.tar.z" or unzip 

"cosi_pak_ibm_09.zip" will creat a directori call "cosi_pak".

         	

onc the file ar expand you should see a singl directori 

"cosi_pak" contain the follow three file, four 

sub-directori and their content:

	at the begin of the "initi" cell of each notebook 

in  "cosi_note" directori, we list the exampl about how to make 

mathematica identifi the directori:



	(* initi of path *)



	(* exampl for a unix machin  (default) *) 

	(*

	$path=join[$path,

chang the pathnam accord to your machin by remov the 

mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' befor and after `$path' 

set.
