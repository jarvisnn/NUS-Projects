hi! i've just instal the new xarchi 2.0.1 and it all work

fine, except:



on our grayscal xterm the custom icon compil into the

program don't work at all, but on the bw termin it work fine.

i can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't

give the neat-o chang when busi action. (other program with

similar action, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.)



the x-interfac author, georg ferguson, suggest it might be a

problem with the x intrins, but isn't will to hack around

to fix it himself. but i know zero about x program, so i

don't think i can find it. 



doe anyon out there know an obviou fix for the problem?



andrew
