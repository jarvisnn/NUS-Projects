hi all,



i've heard of a commerci packag name zink, that could convert ms-window

sourc-code to xwindow sourc-code (c). the onli problem is, the packag

isn't avail in holland (at least, i can't find it anywher :-( )



is there anoth packag (preferr free- or sharewar), that can do the 

same thing? and if so, where can i find or bui it?



thank in advanc
