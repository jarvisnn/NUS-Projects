hi folk,

and i'm have a littl troubl with make/imak.  specif, make bomb

when it need to us ani xaw file.  thi isn't surpris sinc x11 file

on sun with the standard ow 2.0 distribut ar in variou place under

/usr/openwin (xaw file ar in /usr/openwin/share/includ/x11/xaw !!)

actual, the real problem is that i know squat about imak, and i don't

know how to tell imak where the x11 file ar.  i can see from the 

makefil that it's look in the wrong place, but the first line of the 

makefil read 



   # makefil gener by imak - do not edit!



help!  is there some wai i can edit the imakefil to tell it where to

look?  (i have set defin = -dopenwin_bug, as it said to in the readm

file.)



email and post ar both fine.



thank in advanc,



dave
