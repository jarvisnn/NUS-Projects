why do mani (?) peopl believ that xhibit '93 is on of the "paid

market hype nt confer" (as you put it)? i for on am go, becaus

i, too, am curiou about the technolog. i think thi is a great chanc

to learn about nt, mainli becaus:



  - it will be present in x's "home turf". i believ that the attende

    will mostli have x background (bias? :-); thu, i expect that the

    nt present will face a tough audienc.



  - i can be there in person to judg for myself whether or not nt is what

    it is hype to be. thi is as close as i can get to in evalu the

    nt technolog without actual us it myself, which i don't have the

    time to do.



  - if nt turn out to be a vapor technolog and i get bore, there will be

    mani other interest tutori/present that i won't have to

    wast my time ... in california?!?  :-)



just my thought...
