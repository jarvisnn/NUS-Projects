but some peopl, who carri around the attrib program in their pocket,

have still been abl to eras some of the more import file.  ar

an exampl, partit the drive into two partit and have the first

drive contain the import file which can be onli read and the second

drive you could both read and write.  

  ani and all enquiri or help would be appreci.
