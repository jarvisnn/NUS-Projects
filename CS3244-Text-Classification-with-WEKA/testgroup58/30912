is there a wai to connect a powerbook 145, mac iisi, and person laserwrit

ls so that i can (not necessarili silmultaneoulsi) print from either the iisi,

or pb, and file share between the iisi and pb?

i know i can get the ($expens$) lw nt upgrad for my ls, but i can't afford

that...

 

thank, mark
