by night i'm an amiga user. by dai i work with window. i'd be much more 

comfort in window if i had two thing.



1. a good person inform manag. you know- a calendar, address book,

remind list etc... roll into on clean interfac.



2. a good file manag. microsoft is veri poor by my standard. how

about on that ha a left and right window and allow file oper 

between them. be abl to launch program from the same interfac

would be nice. as well as text read and graphic view. those

who ar familiar with directori opu on the amiga know what i'm

look for.



if anyon can steer me toward an ftp sight with these program it would

make my transit to window a lot easier. pleas repli via email

as i rare get to read thi group. thank so much!
