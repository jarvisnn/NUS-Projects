my 66 dx2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.

i am us the pc power and cool cpu cooler.  thi on ha

precis ball bear in the motor.  it ha a pretti substanti

heat sink; so if it happen to fail it would still probabl

dissip more heat than the bare chip.



it attach with peel off adhes.  thi is a full size at case, so

the fan ha graviti in it favor.  i would be a littl nervou about

find the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happen to let

go.



all of the cpu fan that i know of ar power from a drive cabl.

there ar other "board" type fan which ar isa board with a coupl

of fan mount on them.  thei ar power by the slot.  i  don't

know how effect thei ar; mayb someon els could comment.



the cpu is cool enough to touch with the pcp&c unit.



pc-connect at 800-243-8088 ha them for 29.95 + 5.00 next dai

deliveri.  the y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the

power suppli.  pcp&c make the best power suppli avail imho.
