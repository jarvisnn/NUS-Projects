the colormap element of setwinattrib must be a legitim truecolor

colormap. so, us xcreatecolormap() with the proper visual and us it

in setwinattrib (and don't forget the mask!).



and the inevit caveat: i usual us widget, set the visual

and colormap resourc rather than direct x routin, so i could be

wrong. but, i think thi is the gener difficulti.
