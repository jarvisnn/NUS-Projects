i am save an imag on on machin and redisplai the imag on

anoth machin (both ar hp 9000 model 750s).  the imag is creat

us xcreateimag and xgetimag and displai with xputimag.  the

imag is redisplai correctli except that the color ar wrong becaus

the server on the other machin is us a differ colormap.



i tri save the colormap (pixel and rgb valu) and on the redisplai,

perform a tabl lookup against the new colormap.  thi didn't work

becaus some rgb combo don't exist in the new colormap.



is there a wai to forc the server to load color into set pixel valu, or

is there a simpler wai to solv thi problem?  i tri us xinitcolormap

but couldn't get that to work either.



ani help would be appreci.
