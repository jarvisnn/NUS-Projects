     no, it's not true.  you can get scsi and id to work togeth, but

there ar restrict (at least with the adaptec 1542):



* you must boot from the id drive.  there is no wai to boot from the

  scsi drive if you have both id and scsi drive.



* you must disabl the scsi rom bio (i'm not sure about thi, though),

  and so you must also us some special driver to access the scsi

  drive.  (hmm.  i know that you have to disabl someth relat to

  the scsi bio, but i'm not sure if it is the rom itself.)



     back in februari, someon ask about id and scsi (thi question

get ask again and again).  at the end of thi messag, i've includ

an edit copi of my repli.  you might find it interest.

     for msdo applic, isa-base scsi and id control

gener have compar throughput.  you might get slightli higher

throughput with a scsi disk, but you'll also pai more for the disk

($30-$100 and up, in some case).  you'll also pai much, much more for a

good scsi control.



     note that good scsi control realli show their power if thei're

us with a good multitask oper system (like a pc unix).

unfortun, neither msdo nor window 3.1 is a good multitask

oper system.  the perform advantag of scsi control is

mostli wast with these, which leav the advantag of be abl to

connect multipl devic to the scsi bu as the onli advantag.

howev, note that you can expect to pai a premium for scsi devic.



     if you're onli go to be us msdo, stick with id.  it's

cheaper, and you'll have less headach.

[ note: the follow is true for msdo/window onli.  who know what

  the futur hold for window nt and unix??? ]



     no.  gener, you have to find driver for each scsi devic,

which probabl don't exist unless you're us on of the "better"/"high

perform" scsi control.  these ar typic bu-master scsi

control that cost around $180-$400 (street price) and up, and

driver that allow you to connect these control to popular

name-brand scsi devic either come with the card, or can be purchas

(for under $100 list price).  exampl of such driver kit ar:



* adaptec's ez scsi kit (list: $75).  thi work onli with adaptec scsi

  control.



* corelscsi! (from the same peopl who make coreldraw!) (list: $99 (?)).

  thi driver kit will supposedli work with ani scsi control card

  that ha an aspi driver, like the adaptec.



     central point's pc tool for do 8.0 support a number of scsi tape

drive (the document list 40 tape drive).  unfortun, it

work onli with adaptec control.

     ye, you will run into problem, if you're us a

high-perform, bu-master scsi control.  thi doesn't sound

right, doesn't it?  it's true, though.  with on of these control,

you'll probabl have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound

card, floppi-control-base tape drive (like the cm jumbo 250), and

window 3.1.  i know.  i've been to h*ll and back get my scsi

control to work with variou hardwar/softwar (thank god for tape

backup).  if you want a copi of my "adaptec 1542 hint and tip" file,

send email.



     these problem aren't realli the fault of the scsi control card;

the problem ar realli with the gener hardwar and softwar design of

the pc (e.g., no standard).  howev, ad a bu-master scsi card

is what bring these problem to the surfac and make them visibl.



     scsi hold a lot of promis, but you can run into a lot of pc

compat problem.  if you're plan on us onli msdo/window

3.1, stick with id.  if you want to us window nt or a pc unix, you'll

have to make some hard decis: a good scsi control and more than

on scsi hard disk will probabl give you excel perform, at the

possibl cost of msdo compat.  [ i sai, "probabl", becaus,

while i know thi to be true with a pc unix, i don't know if thi realli

will be true of window nt.  i suspect that it will, but i don't know

for sure.  ]
