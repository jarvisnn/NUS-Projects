i have a mac plu with 2.5mb ram. i have just bought an extra 2mb so that

i can have the max 4mb ram that a plu support. howev, i can't get it

to boot after i instal the 2 extra simm. instead i get a sad mac (sorri,

but i can't rememb the code). look at the motherboard, i can see

that 2 resistor have been snip off where it sai "256kb path -

1 row". i assum that wa done when the first 1mb simm were ad.



so, my question is: ar there ani other resistor that need snip? 

				or, do i have bum simm which need to be exchang?



ani and all advic will be appreci.
