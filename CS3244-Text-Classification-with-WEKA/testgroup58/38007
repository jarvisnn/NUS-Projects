i bought a 386dx-40 motherboard for 50$... no document at all. everyth

appear to work, except i'm have troubl get a few of the led connector

work. i've look at the manual for 4 other motherboard, but the pin

configur doesn't look anyth like what is on thi board. doe thi

pin arrang look familiar to anyon out there??? ani hint on where i

can find thi inform?



                 1                 10

      "speaker"  . . . . . . . . . .

      "keylock"  . . . . . . . . . .

                 11          ^     20

                       j23   |

                             |the board came with a jumper vertic across

                              these two pin.



i can get the power/keylock to work across pin 11-15, reset across pin 9 and

shown 82%, press <space> for more, 'q' to quit, or 'h' for help
