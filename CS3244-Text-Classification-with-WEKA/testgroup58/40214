thi problem is caus by a bad interact between the wai olwm repar

window, a misfeatur of the x protocol, and a bug in the xt intrins.  



the intrins bug is that it ignor the (x,y) posit given in

reparentnotifi event.  olwm is structur in such a wai that, when a window

is pop down, the last event the client receiv is a reparentnotifi event. 

at thi point, the intrins' notion of the shell's locat is out of date.



if a setvalu is done us the same (x,y) posit, the intrins think it

need to move the shell, so it issu a configurewindow request to move it

there.  howev, a (mi)featur of the x protocol is that a configurewindow

request that ha no effect will gener no configurenotifi event.  the

intrins thu wait for an event that will never arriv, and time out after

wmtimeout ha expir.  (actual, thing ar somewhat more complex becaus

the request is redirect to the window manag, but the net result is the

same.)



the solut is for the intrins to note the (x,y) posit inform

in reparentnotifi event.  thi ha been implement and is avail in x11r5

public fix 20.  thi is xbug 5513 for those of you who ar interest in

gorier detail.
