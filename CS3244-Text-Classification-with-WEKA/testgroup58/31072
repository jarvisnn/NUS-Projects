the gl file is an archiv contain individu frame or piec of

frame (usual store as .pic or .clp file), font, and a .txt file

that tell the grasp anim system how to displai it.  gl stand

for grasp librari.  there is probabl a detail discuss of thi subject

in the alt.binari.pictur faq.



there ar freeli distribut viewer for gl file, and thei ar usual

name grasprt?.ex (replac the ? with a version digit or letter).  most

gl file contain frame that ar hardwar-specif to particular mode

of the cga, ega, or vga adapt on pc.  i think that there ar some

copi of grasprt avail by anonym ftp (i know that i got on there

a long time ago).



		good luck
