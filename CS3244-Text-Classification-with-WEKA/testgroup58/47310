an automat mail handler at brown univers allow user of "comput

graphic: principl and practic," by folei, van dam, feiner, and

hugh, to obtain text errata and inform on distribut of the

softwar packag describ in the book.  also, user can send the

author feedback, to report text error and softwar bug, make

suggest, and submit exercis.  to receiv inform describ

how you can us the mail handler, simpli mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu

and put the word "help" in the subject line.  us the subject line

"softwar-distribut" to receiv inform specif concern

the softwar packag srgp and sphig.



errata for "an introduct to rai trace" is avail on

wuarchiv.wustl.edu in graphic/graphic/book/introtort.errata.



errata for "digit imag warp" is in the same directori as

"digit-imag-warp.errata".



all c code from the "graphic gem" seri is avail via anonym ftp

from princeton.edu.  look in the directori pub/graphic/graphicsgem for

the variou volum (gem, gemsii, gemsiii), and get the readm file first.



errata to _graphic gem_ and _graphic gem ii is avail on

wuarchiv.wustl.edu in graphic/graphic/book.



a list of comput graphic, comput geometri and imag process

journal is avail from juhana kouhia, jk87377@cs.tut.fi.





2) draw three-dimension object on a two-dimension screen.



the simpl answer is, you divid by the depth.  for a more verbos

explan, see ani of the abov refer, start with:



the folei & van dam & feiner & hugh "comput graphic" book is certainli

a good start.  chapter 6 is "view in 3d", then read chapter 15,

"visibl-surfac determin".  for more inform go to chapter 16 for

shade, chapter 19 for clip, and branch out from there.





3) quantiz 24 bit imag down to 8 bit.



find a copi of "color imag quantiz for frame buffer displai" by

paul heckbert, siggraph '82 proceed, page 297.  there ar other

algorithm, but thi on work well and is fairli simpl.  implement

ar includ in most raster toolkit (see item 7 below).



a variant method is describ in "graphic gem", p. 287-293.  note that

the code from the "graphic gem" seri is all avail from an ftp site,

as describ abov.



check out john bradlei's "divers algorithm", which is incorpor into

the xv packag and describ in the back of the manual.



the imagemagick packag (see section 7 for where it is) contain anoth

quantiz algorithm which is present as "do a better job than the

other algorithm, but slower".



there's also an implement of:



wan, wong, and prusinkiewicz, _an algorithm for multidimension data

cluster_, transact on mathemat softwar, vol. 14 #2 (june, 1988),

pp. 153-162.



avial as princeton.edu:pub/graphic/colorqu.shar.  thi code,

in modifi form, appear in the utah raster toolkit as well.





4) convert color into grayscal.



the ntsc formula is:



    luminos = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue





5) quantiz grayscal to black&white.



the onli refer you need for thi stuff is:



    digit halfton, robert ulichnei, mit press 1987, isbn 0-262-21009-6



but befor you go off and start code, check out the imag manipul

softwar mention in item 7 below.  all of the packag mention can do

some form of grai to b&w convers.





6) rotat a raster imag by an arbitrari angl.



the obviou but wrong method is to loop over the pixel in the sourc

imag, transform each coordin, and copi the pixel to the destin.

thi is wrong becaus it leav hole in the destin.  instead,

loop over the pixel in the destin imag, appli the *revers*

transform to the coordin, and copi that pixel from the sourc.

thi method is quit gener, and can be us for ani on-to-on

2-d map, not just rotat.  you can add anti-alias by do

sub-pixel sampl.



howev, there is a much faster method, with antialis includ,

which involv do three shear oper.  the method wa origin

creat for the im raster toolkit (see below); an implement is

also present in pbmplu.  refer: "a fast algorithm for raster

rotat", by alan paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) graphic

interfac '86 (vancouv).  an articl on the im toolkit appear in

the same journal.  an updat version of the rotat paper appear

in "graphic gem" (see section [1]) under the origin titl.





7) free imag manipul softwar.



there ar a number of toolkit for convert from on imag format to

anoth, do simpl imag manipul such as size scale, plu

the abov-mention 24 -> 8, color -> grai, grai -> b&w convers.

here ar pointer to some of them:

pleas do *not* post or mail messag sai "i can't ftp, could someon

mail thi to me?"  there ar a number of autom mail server that will

send you thing like thi in respons to a messag.  see item 13 below for

detail on some.



also, the newsgroup alt.graphic.pixutil is specif for discuss

of softwar like thi.  you mai find us inform there.





8) format document for tiff, iff, biff, nff, off, fit, etc.



you almost certainli don't need these.  read the abov item 7 on free

imag manipul softwar.  get on or more of these packag and

look through them.  chanc ar excel that the imag convert you

were go to write is alreadi there.  but if you still want on of the

format document, mani such file ar avail by anonym ftp from

zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directori pub/graphic.format.



these file were collect off the net and ar believ to be correct.

thi archiv includ pixel format, and two- and three-dimension object

format.  the futur of thi archiv is uncertain at the moment, as mark

hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will appar no longer be maintain it.



a second graphic file format archiv is now be activ maintain

by quincei koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  the latest version exist at

ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.format/graphic.format.  appar,

neither of these is complet, you might want to check both.



fit stand for flexibl imag transport system. it's a file format most

often us in astronomi.  despit the name, it can contain not onli imag

but other thing as well.  there is a regular monthli fit basic and

inform post on sci.astro.fit - read it if you want to know more.







9) convert between vector format.



a lot of peopl ask about convert from hpgl to postscript, or macdraw

to cgm, or whatev.  it is import to understand that thi is a veri

differ problem from the imag format convers in item 7.  convert

on imag format to anoth is a fairli easi problem, sinc onc you

get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic object

ar the same for all imag format.  thi is not so for vector format.

the basic object -- circl, ellips, drop-shadow pattern-fill

round-corner rectangl, etc. -- vari from on format to anoth.

except in extrem restrict case, it is simpli not possibl to do

a on-to-on convers between vector format.



there is softwar for convert to and from cgm file on ftp.psc.edu.  the

contributor state that it run on unix, ms-window, and possibl the mac.

a better, more specif blurb would be most welcom.



on the other hand, it is quit possibl to do a close approxim,

render an imag from on format us the primit from anoth.

as far as i know, no on ha put togeth a gener toolkit of such

convert, but two differ hpgl to postscript convert have been

post to comp.sourc.misc.  check the index on your nearest archiv

site.



a relat frequent question is how to convert from some vector format

to a bitmap imag - from postscript to sun raster format, or hpgl to

x11 bitmap.  for exampl, some of the commerci postscript clone for

pc's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  also,

the postscript interpret in the next box and in sun's x11/new can

be us to render to a file if you're clever.  but in gener, the

answer is no.  howev, if someon were to put togeth a vector to

vector convers toolkit, ad a vector to raster convert would be

trivial.



gnu ghostscript (from the fsf - current version 2.5.2) includ

driver for both ppm and gif format file, thu it can be us as

a postscript to ppm  or a postscript to gif filter.  (it implement

essenti all of postscript level 1 and alot of displai postscript

and level 2).





10) how to get pixar film.



the variou john lasset / pixar comput anim short ar avail

on video tape.  you can order them from direct cinema limit:



    film                           individu price      institut price

    luxo, jr.				$14.95			$50.00

    red's dream				$19.95			$75.00

    tin toi				$24.95			$75.00

    knickknack				$24.95			$75.00

    luxo, jr./red's dream/tin toi	$39.95			$100.00



all tape ar on 1/2" vh ntsc.  add $10/tape for pal format.  also

avail:



    tin toi t-shirt			$15.00

    knickknack 3d t-shirt		$15.00 (includ glass)



for individu order, add $5 s&h for the first tape or shirt, $2 for

each addit tape or shirt.  for institut order, add $5 s&h

for the first tape, $3 for each addit tape.  foreign ship, add

$3/tape or shirt.  call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 intern,

213-396-3233 fax) to charg to your credit card.  call first to verifi

price and avail.  or, just write to:



    direct cinema limit

    1749 14th street

    santa monica, ca 90404-4342



allan braunsdorf ha thi to sai:



at siggraph thei were sell a tape with all four short

for $25.  that wa a sale price.  you can get it for slightli

more than that normal.  ($35 mayb.)  i believ it's

avail from renderman retail (at pixar's address).



    pixar

    1001 west cut blvd.

    richmond, ca. 94804

    (510) 236-4000 

    (510) 236-0388 (fax)



you can obtain a video directli from pixar which contain "luxo, jr.", "red's

dream", "tin toi" and "knicknack" for $25.00, plu $2.50 for ship. thei

will take your order over the phone or via fax with a major credit card. i 

order mine just last week and receiv it sever dai later. don't expect 

to be abl to rent a copi from your local video store. accord to the licens

agreement print on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rent.





11) how do i draw a circl as a bezier (or b-spline) curv?



the short answer is, "you can't."  unless you us a ration spline you

can onli approxim a circl.  the approxim mai look accept,

but it is sensit to scale.  magnifi the scale and the error of

approxim magnifi.  deviat from circular that were not

visibl in the small can becom glare in the larg.  if you want to

do the job right, consult the articl:



  "a menageri of ration b-spline circl"

  by lesli piegl and wayn tiller

  in ieee comput graphic and applic, volum 9, number 9,

  septemb, 1989, page 48-56.



for rough, non-ration approxim, consult the book:



  comput geometri for design and manufactur

  by i. d. faux and m. j. pratt,

  elli horwood publish, halst press, john wilei 1980.



for the best known non-ration approxim, consult the articl:



  "good approxim of circl by curvatur-continu bezier curv"

  by tor dokken, morten daehlen, tom lych, and knut morken

  in comput aid geometr design, volum 7, number 1-4 (combin),

  june, 1990, page 33-41 [elsevi scienc publish (north-holland)]





12) how to order standard document.



the american nation standard institut sell ansi standard, and also

iso (intern) standard.  their sale offic is at 1-212-642-4900,

mail address is 1430 broadwai, ny ny 10018.  it help if you have the

complet name and number.



some us number to know:



cgm (comput graphic metafil) is iso 8632-4 (1987).  gk (graphic

kernel system) is ansi x3.124-1985.  phig (programm's hierarch

interact graphic system) is ansi x3.144-1988.  ig is asm/ansi

y14.26m-1987.  languag bind ar often separ but relat number;

for exampl, the gk fortran bind is x3.124.1-1985.



standard-in-progress ar made avail at kei mileston to solicit

comment from the graphic public (thi includ you!).  ansi can let

you know where to order them; most ar avail from global engin

at 1-800-854-7179.





13) how to ftp by email.



there ar a number of site that archiv the usenet sourc newsgroup

and make them avail via an email queri system.  you send a messag

to an autom server sai someth like "send comp.sourc.unix/fbm",

and a few hour or dai later you get the file in the mail.



in addit, there is at least on ftp-by-mail server.  send mail to

ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com sai "help" and it will tell you how to us

it.  note that thi servic ha at time been turn off due to abus.





14) how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.



consid a rai origin at the point of interest and continu to

infin.  if it cross an odd number of polygon edg along the wai,

the point is within the polygon.  if the rai cross an even number of

edg, the point is either outsid the polygon, or within an interior

hole form from intersect polygon edg.  thi idea is known in

the trade as the jordan curv theorem; see eric hain' articl in

glassner's rai trace book (abov) for more inform, includ

treatment of special case.



anoth method is to sum the absolut angl from the point to all

the vertic on the polygon.  if the sum is 2 pi, the point is insid,

if the sum is 0 the point is outsid.  howev, thi method is about an

order of magnitud slower than the previou method becaus evalu the

trigonometr function is usual quit costli.



code for both method (plu barycentr triangl test) can be found in

the rai trace new, vol. 5, no. 3, avail from princeton.edu:

pub/graphic/rtnew/rtnv5n3.z.





15) how to tessel a sphere.



on simpl wai is to do recurs subdivis into triangl.  the

base of the recurs is an octahedron, and then each level divid

each triangl into four smaller on.  jon leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>

ha post a nice routin call sphere.c that gener the coordin.

it's avail for ftp on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.



16) specif refer on rai-trace and global illumin.



rick speer maintain a cross-index rai-trace bibliographi:



highlight of thi edit-



    i) more than 500 citat span the period from 1968 through

       novemb '91;

    ii) paper from all siggraph, graphic interfac, eurograph, cg

        intern and ausgraph proceed through decemb, '91;

    iii) all citat keyword for easi lookup;

    iv) cross-indic by keyword and author;

    v)  glossari of the 119 keyword us.



the bib is in the form of a postscript file.  the printout is 41 page long.

below is a list of ftp site and the dir that contain the file. it's name

"speer.raytrac.bib.ps.z" and is compress at most site-

trace relat research paper and book.  the inform is essenti

in plaintext, and latex and troff format program ar includ.  thi

collect is avail at most of the site abov as "rtab.*".



17) siggraph inform onlin



[from steve cunningham and ralph orlick]



acm-siggraph announc it onlin inform site at  siggraph.org

(128.248.245.250).  thi site now provid siggraph inform via both

anonym ftp and an electron mail archiv server.



the anonym ftp servic is veri standard, and the ftp directori includ

both confer and public subdirectori.



to retriev inform by electron mail, send mail to

     archiv-server@siggraph.org

and in the subject or the bodi of the messag includ the messag  send

follow by the topic and subtop you wish.  a good place to start is with

the command

    file ar store in macbinari format and must be download in binari 

    mode.



    each directori contain a tabl of content file (toc) that describ the

    content of each panel file.



(2) by electron mail

    send mail to

       archiv-server@siggraph.org

    you can retriev either the  text  or  rtf  file.  we suggest that you

    first retriev the index file by put on of the messag

       send panel91-txt index

       send panel91-rtf index

    in the subject or bodi of the messag.  you will get the necessari

    inform to retriev the actual transcript file.





19) graphic mail list



there ar a varieti of graphic-relat mail list out there, each

cover either a singl product or a singl topic.  i have been an

activ particip in on of these for some time now, and find the

focu and expertis which can be brought to bear on an isol topic

      question about thi book mai be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridg.ma.us.





21) what about gif?



gif stand for graphic interchang format.  it is portabl and usabl upon

a wide varieti of platform.  it is quit limit in some wai (ye, the

keeper of the faq ha some opinion after all), and in fact, i don't like

it much.  howev, it look to me like the most-frequent ask question

which wa not previous cover in thi list.  the follow is a list

of newsgroup and the like where on could go to find out about gif.

send a messag contain "help" to get gener inform about the

mail server.



also, you could check out the resourc describ in section 7, 8, and

20 abov for more inform.





22) what is morph?



warp is the deform of an imag by map each pixel to a new

locat. morph is blend from on imag or object to anoth on.

valeri hall ha written an excel introduct to warp and

morph. thi is avail for anonym ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au

in the directori pub/graphic/bibliographi/morph. there ar three file:



        morph_intro.ps.z     (postscript version, mani pictur - 1.5m)

        morph_intro.txt.z    (text version)

        m_respons.z        (respons to morph question)



the file ar compress, so you must us binari transfer and

uncompress them afterward.





23) how to rai-trace height field



height field ar a special case in rai-trace.  thei have a number of us,

such as terrain render, and some optim is possibl.  thu, thei

get their own faq section.  note that further refer can no doubt be

locat via the rai-trace bib in section 16 abov.



the follow paper seem to be the definit refer:



f. kenton musgrav

grid trace: fast rai trace for height field

juli, 1988

<musg88.ps.z>



thi is avail as "research report yaleu/dc/rr-639" from yale univers,

it's also in the siggraph '91 fractal model in 3d comput graphic and

imag cours note, and (best of all) it's avail on the net:



    nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/paper/musg88.ps.z

    weedeat.math.yale.edu	pub/paper/musg88.ms.z

    princeton.edu		pub/graphic/paper/musg88.ms.z

24) how to find the area of a 3d polygon



	the area of a triangl is given by (in c notat),



     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -

	            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );



and the area of a planar polygon is given by



     area = 0.0;



     for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )

         area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );

     area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );

     area /= 2.0;



if the area is a neg number, the polygon or triangl is

clockwis, if posit, it is counterclockwis.



>from ronald golman's gem (in graphic gem ii - see section 1 abov), "area

 of planar polygon and volum of polyhedra:"



the area of a polygon p0, p1, p2, ... pn, not in the x-y plane, is

given by



     area(polygon) = 1/2 * | n . sigma { pk x pk+1 } |



where n is the unit vector normal to the plane and p is a polygon

vertex.  the . repres the dot product oper and the x

repres the cross product oper.  sigma repres the summat

oper.  | | repres the absolut valu oper.  pn+1 is equal

to p0.





25) how to join acm/siggraph
