ye, thei ar nice ad, and even better: great price.  but thi is all on 

the outsid.  the consum see thi and order.  littl do thei know, thei 

will get *poor* servic (veri poor).  when i order a 105mb hard drive from 

tc about 6 month ago, i receiv it in the mail, instal it, and 

discov it didn't work!!!  i sent it back to them, and thei said thei'd 

send me a refund check.  it took mani, mani, mani phone call and hate-mail, 

as well as threat of lawsuit to get back my $250.00!  in fact, it took two 

whole month of call and threaten!  everi time i'd call, i would be 

put on the run-around until i final wound up on an answer machin.  i'd 

leav my name and phone #, but i didn't even get call back *onc*.  i am 

on piss off t.c. custom, 	and if you don't want to get rip off, or 

if you want decent servic, do not --i repeat-- do not bui from thi 

compani.  the monei save is not worth the ulcer you will get.  pass thi 

word around to your friend.  		compani like thi do not deserv 

to stai in busi, so let's not give them out hard earn monei.  



discount micro, system powerhous, and gatewai 2000 all have given me 

excel servic and speed in the past.  i highli recommend them to anyon.
