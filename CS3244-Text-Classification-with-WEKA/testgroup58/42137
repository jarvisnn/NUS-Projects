if you alreadi own all the "clone" equip then there ar lot of such

program (see a current copi of unix world magazin).



*but*  your perform will suck lemon run an xserver on a clone.

(from experi).  you would be much better off with an xtermin if thi

is a new instal.  the perform will be at least four time better.

in addit it would be much easier to instal and us.  on top of that

thei will cost about the same (price a clone with 4mb ram, ethernet card,

veri high perform graphic card, good monitor, server softwar, tcp/ip

for clone softwar, mous, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole

lot of $$$$).



i can get 15" tektronix xp11 termin for under $900, and the perform

is over 80000 xstone.....
