it's back!!!!!!



congratul, you've just discov a veri nasti, and veri frequent

ecount, bug in the word setup program. onc you know what is wrong, it

is quit easi to fix. go into the font dialog under control panel, and select

the two font mt extra and fenc. delet them, but onli delet the list

entri, not the disk file. now select add, and add the font mt extra plain

and fenc plain. close the font box, close control panel, and restart word.

everyth should be alright now.



doe anyon know if microsoft ha fix thi thing yet? thei have to know

about it by now, it's been so frequent report.
