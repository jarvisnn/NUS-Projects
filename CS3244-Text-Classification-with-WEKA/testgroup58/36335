	path of least resist (tm) :) :

get wingif 1.4 from cica (ftp.cica.indiana.edu pub/pc/win3/(desktop?) )

it will save to nativ .rle format unlik psp (an otherwis fine, fine prog)

make a file us anyth that ha to be less than 30k, as michael said,

and less than 16 color... import it to wingif as gif, pcx or bmp and

save it in you window/system subdir as vgalogo.rle (not .lgo). exit win,

and run setup in the window subdir. reselect your _current_ config. run

win. voila'

(minor correct: the .rle file ha to be <30k. that mean ~15k gif ?)

hope it help... (and pleas, pleas someon put thi in the group's faq)
