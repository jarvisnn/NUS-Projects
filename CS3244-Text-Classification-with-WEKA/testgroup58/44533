i think it is import to clear up your first repli.  you gave the

impress that you should not us smartdriv with stacker.   you ar

correct re: cach the compress drive.  howev, as i understand it,

you can cach the uncompress drive.  thu if you have compress your

disk c:, you will have a c and probabl a d drive under stacker.  c be

the compress disk (which is just a larg file on d:) and d be the

uncompress disk.  you should onli attempt to stack d:.  in fact, with

win 3.1 and smartdrv.ex, it seem smart enough to automat default

to stack your a,b and d drive.
