ar you sure it's not a problem caus by softwar?  i've seen thi sort 

of effect when a runawai program (which could be caus by an init 

conflict, for instanc) accident wack on a regist in the video 

hardwar.  have you tri boot with no extens and then let the 

q950 just sit there in the finder?  you might also want to try chang to 

24-bit address (ye, i know you can't access your full 64 mb of ram - 

it's just an experi) as the video hardwar regist can't be access 

then.



anoth thing to try as a 'recoveri' measur is to us someth like 

quickkei to chang the pixel depth of the displai.  thi reprogram (some 

of) the video hardwar regist and mai allow sync to be restor.
