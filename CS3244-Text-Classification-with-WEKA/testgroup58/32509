   i have a 386dx clone, with a dtc esdi control and toshiba 660

mbyte

drive. sinc instal do 6.0, when i tri to re-instal softwar

from

5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disk, when i mount the second..third..fourth disk, do

6

doesn't recogn that i have chang floppi. if i do a "dir", i see

the

content of the previou diskett. the onli wai to get do to recogn

that

diskett have chang, is to do a "label", and then to not label them.



   bui do 6.0 ha been a coloss mistak. do 5.0 wa stabl, and

work

well with my equip. i have superstor pro, and desqview/x ( with

qemm, 

manifest, etc), so there aren't ani featur of do 6 that i am us. i

guess

i should roll back to do 5.0 but i am wari of what will happen when i

do it.



   besid, like a fool, i don't have a do 5. bootabl disk anymor.

i've

made the same mistak i caution my user not to make. like sheep, i

join 

the crowd flock to do 6. baaa baaad system administr.
