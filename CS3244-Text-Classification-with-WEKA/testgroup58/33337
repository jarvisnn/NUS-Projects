i am just begin to try us the athena toolkit and am have some problem 

get start.  i think that some file ar miss on the system, but there is

the possibl that thei ar just in a differ directori.  when i try to link

my program it can't find xtinitail, xtrealizewidget, xtmainloop, 

xtcreatemanagedwidget, or commandwidgetclass.  i've includ intrins.h and

command.h.  i also had a problem on compil with xtncallback but replac that with

a null in order to compil and see if there were ani other problem.  i haven't 

us a toolkit befor and thi is simpli an exampl i got from the manuel.  can

someon tell me where i might look for these call, that is, in what file not what

directori thei ar suppos to be under becaus the system manag doesn't believ

in standard directori and gener doe thing hi own wai.  (i am us unix)



thank you for your assist.
