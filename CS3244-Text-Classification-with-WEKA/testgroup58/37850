or perhap you write a freeli avail, gpled unix for commonli

avail comput platform (i386/i486 machin) and becom a catalyst

for a major netwid project which produc a better unix-like os than

mani commerci counterpart (see comp.os.linux for detail).  or mayb

you found a legu for program freedom to fight restrict litig

and softwar patent practic, therebi protect the creativ freedom

so vital to continu progress in our field.  or mayb you start up

a gnu project, and produc by far and awai the best c/c++ compil

for unix there is, not to mention other valuabl util.



some hacker make signific contribut without sell out their

ideal.  as for bill gate, after pawn of grossli inferior softwar

onto the pc market for ten year, if he ever wa a hacker, he deserv

to have hi name erad from the annal of comput hackeri.



as for me, i like run linux+x+countless other packag, without

pai a dime.  on the other hand, i have no problem purchas motif

or other good softwar, as long as microsoft hasn't foul it with their

inept input.



my 2 cent worth, flame will be patient ignor. :-)



jean.
