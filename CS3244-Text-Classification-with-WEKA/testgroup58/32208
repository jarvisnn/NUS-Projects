on a more cheer note, perhap hacker/hack isn't complet dead.



as someon els said, take the gnu offer for exampl - free, redistribut and 

often better than the commerci stuff.  take also the number of paper publish

everi year in all the field of comput scienc - the vast major of these paper

detail origin work of real, often except merit - and the author ar share

thi knowledg.



have fun,
