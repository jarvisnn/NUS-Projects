as far as i know, there is no wai to get around the bio password except by 

short out the power suppli to the cmo memori, therebi eras it. thi 

will remov the password, but it will also destroi all the previou bio 

set, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. on my 386, 

there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provid for the purpos of 

short the batteri. you just short thi jumper briefli, and it interrupt 

power to the cmo long enough to eras it. i would imagin there is 

someth like thi on your board too. 



in the futur, i would suggest that you set the password, and leav it on 

"setup" onli. that wai, no-on els can go and reset it or set it to "

alwai" unless thei know what password you us. thei had to do thi over 

here too when thei got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason.
