on usual suggest is to put everyth into your everi-time shell rc-file

instead of your login-onli on, which is fair enough if you onli have a few

user who know what thei're do.  if you have sever hundr user who do

what the book tell them, though, then it's confus at best.  anoth is to

have your xterm run login shell, but that still leav the window manag

and the thing that get start from it menu with the wrong environ.



our altern is that instead of have xdm run the client startup script,

it run the user's favourit shell as a login shell, and ha *it* then run the

rest of the startup script.  that wai the user's usual environ get set

up as normal and inherit by everyth.  you can find an almost-current copi

of our script and thing in contrib/edinburgh-environ.tar.z, avail

from the usual place.
