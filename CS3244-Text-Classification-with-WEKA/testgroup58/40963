like it or not stock price and sale of a particular product ar measur

of success. thei can be measur of short term or long term success. i think

in ms case thei ar a good measur of their long term success. the origin

post mention how it seem on thi group that there ar a larg number

of peopl attack ms and not will to accept anyth posit about ms.

i wa try to make a point that the attack ar over emphas and to

look at the sale of ms product thei definit tell a differ stori.



i also think a larg number of the attack or debat as you call

them ar highli technic. look around in the real world peopl don't want

to grep and auck and ls -l thei just want to push the button and get their 

job done on a reason price piec of hardwar that doe not need 

a comput smart gui to load configur etc etc. like it or not ms and the

multitud of busi applic that exist to run under window doe

thi and doe it well. we ar run 150 pc's load with a complet

suit of mostli ms window applic in an administr busi

function on a novel network run all softwar off the server.

it doe the job quit well and if we had it to do over again we would pick

window again. 

again i repeat to ms keep do what you ar do. you ar do a great

job.

flame on

thx dave l
