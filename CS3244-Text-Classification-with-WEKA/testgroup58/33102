i would like to know as well, sinc i just bought a 200mb seagat id

drive and want to add it to my comput (a four-year-old gatewai

386/20), which current ha an 80mb seagat scsi drive.  the scsi

control is such that the doc told me not to specifi it in the cmo

setup, i.e. both hard drive set ar list as "not instal,"

and appar the scsi control work it wonder.  i wonder if

thi is a problem.  also, i rememb how, when i help my cousin

instal hi second id drive, we had to defin a master/slave

relationship for them; do i need to do someth similar here?



>i am particularli interest in have the scsi as the _boot_ drive.

asap; i'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) befor i start.
