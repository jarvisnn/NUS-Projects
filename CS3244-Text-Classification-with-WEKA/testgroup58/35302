i've notic a recent prolifer of 1 gig scsi-2 3.5" drive, in

particular, the fujitsu 2694 and the micropoli 2112. there is also the

maxtor lxt1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive. thei ar all quit cheap,

and have nice 3-5 year warranti.

                  which on is better?

                  what type of scsi-2 do these drive us?

                  is the servic gener better for on of these     

         

                  manufactur?
