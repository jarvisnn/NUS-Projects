i have a question for y'all:



i'm look at an ad for the new 3.5" fast scsi-2 drive from micropoli

in the june, 1993, macworld. (i have seen similar ad for the id version

in ibm pc magazin)



well, the ad sai that all three drive have a fast scsi-2 interfac,

but then it sai that the dtr rate for each drive is 5 megabyt/second,

*max*.



how can thi be?  i thought that if a drive wa to be fast scsi-2 it

had to have a dtr of 10meg a second?



(i am assum the 5meg/sec claim by micropoli is from the 512k cach.

i admit that i would be veri impress if the drive can *read/write* data

at 5meg a second!)



thank you.
