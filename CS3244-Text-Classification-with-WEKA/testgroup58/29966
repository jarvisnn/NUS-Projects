adob streamlin ha been out four a coupl of year. it doe a much better

job than the autotrac function which ar built into illustr

program. of cours, a higher resolut bitmap will produc a more

accur trace. the problem that i've run into though, is that when it

creat a detail trace, it produc wai more point than ar necessari.

if i trace someth manual, i us mani less es point. the problem

with thi is it produc big file which slow everyth down, especi

print.
