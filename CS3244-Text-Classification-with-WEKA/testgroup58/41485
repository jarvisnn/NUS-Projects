in the list you mention, tgif handl everyth except rotat and

ani size text.  it onli support 90 degre rotat.  current, it

support 11 (x11r4 standard) font size.  howev, it allow arbitrari

scale of the entir draw.  effect, it allow ani font size, but

you can onli have 11 differ size per draw.



tgif take up 850k (compil with -o option) on a sparcstat.  i wa told

that it compil under linux, but i haven't tri it yet.  it work with

both color and monochrom x.
