you can't custom a command line interfac?  where have you been?  i

can chang the prompt, i can make alias (so someon like me who is

us to sai, ls, can type it on my do machin and still get a

directori list), and under unix, if i don't like the command line

interfac, i throw it out and get a differ on. (csh, bash, ksh,

sh, etc...)

a decent gui for all variat of unix? lesse... what about motif?

or the stuff from mit? (twm come to mind...) those ar pretti

standard. heck, an xwindow program run like it like to -- all the

end user ha to realli know is how to manipul the actual window

with the mous, and sinc it is a gui, it's *graphic* and a bit

easier to figur out. (someth the window peopl have been press

down our throat for some time now...)



the thing i fear is that there will be a gap between the normal user

run window (all flavor) and the other "power" user run unix

and other more advanc os. at least right now, do is still pretti

much king. i can bring a copi of my latest whiz-bang program demo

over to my friend hous, and sinc we both run do, he can enjoi it

too.
