here is anoth hint:



	i have a realli jump mous (ps2 type), and final the mous

stop jump chang himem.sy (ye, himem!), is you us:



devic=himem.sy /m:x



x can be 1,2,...,8 (of cours my comput don't appear on the list for

these paramet)



 and mayb, your mous can stop jump... (but your problem look more

like a dirti mous ;)...



	hope it help (to anybodi!)
