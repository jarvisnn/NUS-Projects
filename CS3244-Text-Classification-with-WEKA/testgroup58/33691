fwb distribut hdt person edit (hdt = hard drive toolkit), which

is what i own. thi is less fanci than the "full" version, but good

enough for what you and i want to do. casa blanca offer drive7, but

i'm not that familiar with it. i *think* that both drive7 and hdt pe

can be had for around us$50.



i've us silverling at work (v 5.42??), and i like hdt pe much

better. imho it ha a better interfac, and easier to understand.



ani drive7 user?
