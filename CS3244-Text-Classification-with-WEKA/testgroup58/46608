there might be an ipa routin that doe that,but i can'r be sure.  anoth

wai to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the

imag.  then assign that imag to your glass object as a reflect.  it will

take a lot of adjust for posit and size of the reflect, but that's

the onli thing i can think of.
