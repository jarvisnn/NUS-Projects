i understood that there ar two method to connect applic code to widget:



                       callback and action



the problem i face now is that i have a quit long piec of applic code

that perform a lot of draw into a window. i want to connect thi to a

widget. no problem so far. i could us a callback function or an action to do thi, process ani event afterward.



but becaus the draw take some while, i want the applic code sequenc

to be abl to be interrupt by event. then i want to handl the event

and resum with process the applic code at the point it wa

interrupt.

it seem to me that thi isn't possibl, but how can i give the user the

impress that hi input ar immedi process ?



ha anybodi an idea?



pleas answer via e-mail.



thank in advanc.
