ok, i'm be driven batti.





try to creat popup-menu (ie. button3 press, and a menu

appear).  i would realli like to us the standard athena

class to achiev thi goal, but for my best attempt

i cannot get the menu to come up without us a menubutton

as the parent of the widget tree.  i know thi should be

possibl to to with an xtpopupspringload() and a

littl twiddl, but someth is escap me.
