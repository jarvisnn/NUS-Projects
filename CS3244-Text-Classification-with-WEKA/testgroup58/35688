	intro to access.bu (re: the access.bu softwar creator's 

	contest announc)



what is access.bu?



access.bu is a new open industri standard for comput 

peripher connect.  access.bu is a serial protocol that 

us simpl, low-cost i2c technolog to link multipl devic to 

a singl pc port.  peripher devic such as keyboard or 

keypad, locat (mice, trackbal, joystick), printer, vr 

glove, digit, sensor, actuat or data transmitt and 

other can be easili daisi chain to the host pc.  applic 

such as cad/cam, data acquisit, simul, virtual realiti, 

multipl-player/singl pc game, educ and mani, mani more 

can now take advantag of access.bu, the technolog that put 

plug and plai on everi pc.



the access.bu offer advantag to end-user and develop of 

system and peripher.  multipl devic connect to the host 

comput with onli on port.  common commun method for a 

number of devic type lead to simplifi hardwar and softwar 

develop.  as an open standard, access.bu enabl cross-

platform us of the same devic.



access.bu technolog descript:

=====================================



access.bu technolog is an open specif, enabl anyon 

to implement it on host system or in peripher devic without 

fee or royalti.

access.bu ha a bu topolog architectur.  that is, a singl 

host can accommod up to 125 peripher devic.  access.bu 

data rate is 100 kbit/sec.



access.bu physic layer

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

access.bu is a serial bu architectur, base on i2c hardwar 

protocol, with on data line and on clock line.

standard low-cost i2c microcontrol handl bit-level 

handshak, includ automat arbitr and clock 

synchron.  



access.bu softwar protocol

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

the access.bu commun protocol is compos of three 

level: i2c protocol, base protocol, and applic protocol.



i2c protocol: thi simpl and effici protocol defin 

arbitr among contend master without lose data.  i2c 

provid for cooper synchron of bu partner with 

differ clock rate.  bu transact includ address, 

frame of bit into byte, and byte acknowledg by the 

receiv.  



base protocol: establish the asymmetr interconnect between 

a host comput and multipl peripher.  the host becom the 

access.bu manag.  the base protocol defin the format of an 

access.bu messag envelop, which is an i2c bu transact with 

addit semant, includ checksum.

uniqu featur of the base protocol ar auto-address and hot 

plug.  auto-address assign devic with uniqu bu 

address, without the need for set jumper or switch.  hot 

plug is the abil to attach and detach devic while the 

system is run, without reboot.



applic protocol: thi is the highest level of the access.bu 

protocol which defin messag semant specif to particular 

type of devic.  each type requir a differ applic 

protocol.  three broad devic type have been identifi: 

keyboard, locat, and text devic.



access.bu support on the pc

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

all three level of the access.bu protocol ar support on the 

pc.  an add-on card implement the physic layer and us the 

base protocol to commun with physic access.bu devic.  

an access.bu manag - tsr under do and a dll under window 3.1 

- control the oper of the physic layer and interact with 

the access.bu devic driver.  driver ar avail for 

multipl access.bu keyboard, locat and printer for do and 

window 3.1.  also avail ar c languag sourc code exampl 

of the interfac from applic to the devic driver.
