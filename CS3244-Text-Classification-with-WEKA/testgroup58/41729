i have place a new releas of my ax editor in ax-5.0.tar.z on

export.lc.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).



the signific chang thi time, and the justif for the hike

in the major version number, is:



  o undo ha been implement.



    by default onli the last chang can be undon, but a resourc is

    provid to allow the user to specifi how mani, includ unlimit,

    level of undo inform should be kept. also, undo of undo is

    support.



there is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be emax 19 :-)



                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-



for those who have not encount ax befor here is a summari of

what it is all about:



ax is a simpl to us text editor for x that repres a signific

improv over xedit. also built around the athena text widget it

featur, amongst other thing,



   o multipl window

   o multipl buffer

   o default menu interfac

   o option button interfac, with choic and layout of button 

     under user control

   o minibuff for expert us and access to extern filter

   o provis for defin a keyboard macro

   o geometri specif and resiz in term of charact

   o file select via a browser

   o knowledg of line number

   o parenthesi match

   o regular express search

   o restrict or unlimit undo

   o abil to chang font

   o easi entri of control code

   o xterm-like keymap featur

   o easi runtim set of select prefer (resourc)

   o both brief and comprehens on-line help

   o server mode with cooper client program

   o option extens languag us tcl

   o option xaw3d widget set compat

   o collect of reusabl widget that embodi the function of ax



i have person built and run core ax, i.e. without the tcl and

xaw3d option, on the follow system:



   sun sparc        suno 4.1.x     mit x11r5

   sun sparc        suno 5.1       mit x11r5

   encor multimax  umax 4.3        mit x11r5

   dec 5000/120     ultrix 4.2      mit x11r5

   hp 9000/710      hp-ux 8.07      mit x11r5

   mac iici         au/x 3.0        mit x11r5

   

but not all have been subject to the same level of test. i have

onli test the tcl and xaw3d option on the first.



a number of '#ifdef sysv'-ism that have been fed back to me have been

incorpor into the code and a possibl scandir replac is

provid for those system that do not have on.



although ax will probabl build under r4 run-time problem have been

encount in the past. i have not bother to try thi version under

r4, and have not put ani effort into solv previous known

problem.  therefor, if you ar at r4 you veri much take pot luck. if

it doesn't work the onli altern is to try the last releas,

2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. it doesn't have as

mani featur and us the widget creation librari (wcl). not onli

that, it requir an old version of wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. version 3 of

ax wa near complet when version 2 of wcl came out so ax 2

never got convert to make us of it.



ax is avail by anonym ftp from export.lc.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)

and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initi, and probabl in due

cours from sever other ftp site.  check your nearest us

xarchi.



if you can't ftp, try send email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the

word "help" alon in your messag bodi.  you will receiv instruct

on how to ftp via email.
