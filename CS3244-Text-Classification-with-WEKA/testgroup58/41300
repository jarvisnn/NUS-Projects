keyword: color



most graphic system i have seen have draw routin that also specifi

a color for draw, like



drawpoint(x,y,color) or drawlin(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or

fillrectangl(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) 



with x, i have to do someth like 

xsetforeground(current_color)

xdrawpoint(d,w,x,y)



why split thi into two function? why did x design decid to not associ

the color with the object be drawn, and instead associ it with the

displai it is be drawn on?
