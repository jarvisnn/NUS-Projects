        interest, as i think comput technolog is now

becom widespread enough now that it is no longer a posit

which must requir a degre.  i know of sever peopl i work

with that make just as much as i do and thei don't even have

a bs degre in comp sci. yet thei make 28+ a year.  thei also

didn't have to pai 30 grand to thier local univers either. :(

       i think comput program is be reduc to a trade

practic, than a truli specialti field.  it will be even more

so in the futur.

       if your interest in cut edg type of stuff and you

choos cs as i did, i suggest check out the emerg field

of softwar engin.  the difficulti for exampl of design

scaleabl design environ for individu so that a singl person

can handl 100,000 to 1,000,000 million line of code all by himself

in a reason manner and then incorpor that into a teamwork enviro

is truli a gigant problem...not go to be solv ani time soon

unfortun...but hei you could be the person that provid

the miss kei for some good groundwork!

well, if your like the poor slob in the world..like me, you ar

in no financi posit to continu graduat work right out

of a top 10 comp sci school.



the trick is, to find some gener inc you work for to pai for the

rest of your educ...trust me it the best wai to go..even

if you don't get a top salari.  which i have alwai been a poor

slob throughout school but if you follow thi rule: book=salari=food&shelter

you should alwai have a comput and you won't go hungri.



what els could a man want?!
